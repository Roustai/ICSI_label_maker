# ICSI_label_maker
This script generates the gold standard labels that can be found in here http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/icsi/download/

To run the script you will need to have downloaded the ICSI Plus and ICSI-original_transcript and have them unzipped in the same directory.

After that just enter python ICSI-cleanup.py <ICSI_directory> and a folder called place_holder will populate will all the transcripts.

Code was developed by Alexander Roustai at the UCF NLP group and is free to use.
