"fe004"::	What?::	0
"me003"::	All at the same  time.  I don't know if - I would get distracted and confused, probably.::	0
"me010"::	e-::	0
"fe004"::	Really?  Do we have to like,  synchronize?::	0
"me010"::	Well, I think you're supposed to - O_K. We can do this. Everybody's got different digits, right?::	0
"me045"::	Are you being silly?::	0
"me003"::	Oh wait  do we  have t-::	0
"me045"::	Uh .::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me003"::	Yeah, do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping -::	0
"fe004"::	You're kidding.::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"mn015"::	No, no, just - just start whenever you want.::	0
"fe004"::	And any rate?::	0
"me010"::	e-  yeah , the-::	0
"me045"::	Alright.::	0
"me010"::	Well, they - they have s- they have the close talking microphones for each of us, so -::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, that's true.::	0
"me045"::	Alright.::	0
"me010"::	yeah, there's separate channels.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0

"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Does matter for  them.::	0
"fe004"::	Are we gonna start  all  our meetings out that way from now on?::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"fe004"::	Oh. Too bad. I kinda like it.::	0
"me045"::	Well, could we?::	0
"me003"::	It's strangely satisfying.::	0

"me003"::	Oh yes, and that  too.::	0
"mn015"::	Not - not rehearse, I mean, I have just not spent any time on it, so I can show you what I've got, get your input on it, and maybe some suggestions, that would be great.::	0
"mn015"::	And the  same  is true for the  proposal.::	0
"mn015"::	I  will  have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains. So,::	0
"mn015"::	um.::	0
"mn015"::	I don't know how::	0

"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	And so::	0
"mn015"::	they're supposed to imagine that, you know,::	0
"mn015"::	do they think the person wants to go there, or just know where it is? Uh,::	0
"mn015"::	which is probably  not,  uh, the case::	0
"mn015"::	in that discotheque example, or in the Bavaria example, you just want to know where it  is.::	0
"mn015"::	And so forth. So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it's nine - nine P_M in the evening then the discotheque question would be, for example,::	1
"mn015"::	one that might ask for  directions  instead of just  location.::	1
"mn015"::	Um,  and so forth and so forth. That's sort of motivating it.::	1
"mn015"::	Then what have we done so far? We had our little bit of, um,::	1

"mn015"::	I mean I  might  even mention that this work you're doing is sort of also with the M_P_I in  Leipzig,  so.::	1
"fe004"::	It's - it's certainly related, um,::	0
"mn015"::	Because, um, E_M_L is building up a huge thing in Leipzig.::	1
"fe004"::	might wanna say.::	0
"fe004"::	Is it?::	0
"mn015"::	So it -::	0
"mn015"::	It's on biocomputation.  Would -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, it's  different,  this is the, uh, D_N_A building, or someth- the double helix building.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Kind of a different level of analysis.::	0
"me010"::	The - yeah it was - it turns out that if - if you have multiple billions of dollars,::	0
"me010"::	y- you can do::	0
"me010"::	all sorts of weird things, and -::	0
"me003"::	Wait, they're building a-::	0
"fe004"::	What?::	0
"me003"::	building  in the shape of D_N_A, is that what you said?::	0
"me010"::	Roughly, yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Oh! Oh boy!::	0
"me010"::	Including cr- cross-bridges, and::	0
"fe004"::	O-::	0
"fe004"::	What?::	0
"me045"::	That's brilliant!::	0
"fe004"::	Oh my god!::	0
"me045"::	Hhh.   Oy.::	0
"me010"::	You d- you  really  - now I- I spent - the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story::	0
"me010"::	which is, um -::	0
"fe004"::	Of::	0
"me003"::	Y- You definitely wanna w- don't wanna waste that money on  research,  you know?::	0
"fe004"::	what the building?::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me003"::	That's horrible.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Well, no, no, y-::	0
"me010"::	i- there's  infinite  money. See you th- you th- you then  fill  it with  researchers.::	0
"fe004"::	And give them more money. They just want a fun place for them to - to work.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	And everybody gets a trampoline in their office.::	0
"mn015"::	Well, the - the offices are actually a little - the, think of um, ramps, coming out of the double helix and then you have these half-domes, glass half-domes, and the offices are in - in the glass half-dome.::	0
"fe004"::	Really?::	0
"me045"::	Alright, let's stop talking about this.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Does it exist yet?::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Uh, as a model.::	0
"fe004"::	They are w- now building it?::	0
"fe004"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	But I th-::	0
"me010"::	So, yeah, I think that's - that's a good point, th- th- that the date, the, uh,::	0
"me010"::	a lot of the - this  is  interacting with,::	0
"me010"::	uh, people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig::	0
"me010"::	and::	0
"me010"::	the -::	0
"me010"::	the b- the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys, yeah.::	1
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Anyway!  Enough of that, let's talk about your thesis proposal.::	1
"mn015"::	Yeah, if somebody has something to say.::	0
"me010"::	Yep.::	0
"me045"::	You might want to, uh, double-check the spellings of the authors' names on your references, you had a few, uh,::	1
"me045"::	misspells in your slides, there. Like I believe you had "Jackendorf".::	1
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"me045"::	Uh, unless there's a person called "Jackendorf", yeah.::	0
"me010"::	No, no, no.::	0
"fe004"::	On  that  one?::	0
"me045"::	But that's the only thing I noticed in there.::	0
"fe004"::	In the presentation?::	0
"me045"::	In the presentation.::	0
"fe004"::	I'll probably - I c- might have - I'll probably have comments for you separately, not  important .  Anyway.::	0
"mn015"::	Oh, in the  presentation  here. I was ac- actually worried about  bibtex.  Uh. No,  that's  quite possible.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, that's what he was talking about.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	That's copy and paste from::	0
"mn015"::	something.::	0
"me010"::	So I did note- i- i- it looks like the, uh,  metaphor  didn't get in yet.::	1
"mn015"::	Uh, it  did,  there is a reference to Srini -::	0
"me010"::	Well, s- reference is  one  thing, the question is is there any place - Oh, did you put in something about,::	0
"fe004"::	Metonymy and metaphor here, right?::	0
"me010"::	uh, the individual,::	0
"me010"::	we'd talked about putting in something::	0
"me010"::	about people had,::	0
"me010"::	uh - Oh yeah, O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Good.  I  see where you have it.::	0
"me010"::	So the top of the second - of pa- page two you have a sentence.::	1
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	But,::	0
"me010"::	what I  meant  is,::	0
"me010"::	I think  even   before  you  give  this,::	0
"me010"::	to Wahlster,::	0
"me010"::	uh, you should,::	0
"me010"::	unless  you put it in the text, and I don't think it's there yet,  about - we  talked  about is the, um,  scalability  that you get by, um,::	0
"me010"::	combining the constructions with the general  construal  mechanism. Is that in there?::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, mmm. Um.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, O_K, so where - where is it, cuz I'll have to take a look.::	0
"mn015"::	Um, but I - I did not focus on  that  aspect but, um -::	0
"mn015"::	Ehhh,::	0
"mn015"::	um, it's just underneath, uh,::	0
"mn015"::	um,::	0
"mn015"::	that reference to metaphor. So it's the last paragraph::	0
"mn015"::	before two. So on page two,::	0
"mn015"::	um, the main focus -::	0
"me010"::	Uh, O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	But that's really -::	0
"fe004"::	That's not about that,  @@  is it?::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	No, it - it -::	1
"me010"::	it s-  says  it but it doesn't say - it doesn't - it d- it d- yeah, it doesn't give the punch line.::	1
"mn015"::	Why.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line  is,  because it's actually important,::	0
"me010"::	which is, that,::	1
"me010"::	the::	0
"me010"::	constructions,  that, uh, Nancy and Keith and friends are doing,::	0
"me010"::	uh, are,::	0
"me010"::	in a  way,  quite  general::	1
"me010"::	but::	1
"me010"::	cover only base cases. And::	1
"me010"::	to make them apply::	0
"me010"::	to  metaphorical  cases and  metonymic  cases and all those things, requires this additional mechanism,::	0
"me010"::	of  construal.  And the punch line is, he claimed,::	1
"me010"::	that::	0
"me010"::	if you do this  right,  you can get::	0
"me010"::	essentially orthogonality, that::	1
"me010"::	if you introduce a new construction::	0
"me010"::	at - at the base level, it should com- uh, interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work.::	1
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	And, similarly, if you introduce a new metaphor,::	1
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	it should then::	0
"me010"::	uh, compose with all of the constructions.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	And it - to the extent that that's  true  then - then::	0
"me010"::	it's a  big  win over anything that  exists.::	0
"me003"::	So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your::	0
"me003"::	context-free grammar::	0
"me003"::	you just have::	0
"me003"::	these  base  constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	So that, you know, for example,::	0
"me010"::	uh, in the metaphor case, that you have a kind of direct::	0
"me010"::	idea of a source, path, and goal::	0
"me010"::	and any metaphorical one - and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff  - you::	0
"me010"::	can  do  the same  grammar.::	0
"me010"::	And it  is  the same grammar.::	0
"me003"::	Mmm.::	0
"me010"::	But,::	0
"me010"::	um, the trick is that the -::	0
"me010"::	the way the  construction's  written::	0
"me010"::	it requires that the object of the  preposition   for example be a container.::	0
"me010"::	Well, "trouble" isn't a container, but it gets constr-  construed  as a c- container.::	0
"me003"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Et cetera. So that's -::	0
"me010"::	that's where this, um,::	0
"me003"::	So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	So's it's - it -::	0
"me010"::	it's a very big deal, i- i- in this framework, and the::	0
"me010"::	thesis proposal as it stands doesn't,::	0
"me010"::	um,  I  don't think, say that as clearly as it  could.::	0
"mn015"::	No, it doesn't say it at  all.  No.::	0
"mn015"::	Even though -::	0
"mn015"::	One could argue what - if there  are  basic cases, even.::	0
"mn015"::	I mean, it seems like  nothing  is context- free.::	1
"me010"::	Oh,  nothing  is context- free,::	1
"me010"::	but there  are  basic  cases.  That is,::	1
"me010"::	um, there are physical containers, there are physical paths, there - you know, et cetera.::	1
"mn015"::	But "walked into the cafe and ordered a drink," and "walked into the cafe and broke his nose," that's sort of -::	1
"me010"::	Oh, it doesn't mean that they're  unambiguous.  I mean, a cafe  can  be construed as a container, or it  can  be construed::	1
"mn015"::	Mmm. Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me010"::	you know as - as a obstacle, or as some physical object. So there are  multiple   construals.::	0
"me010"::	And in fact that's  part  of what has to be  done.  This is why there's this interaction between the analysis::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	and the construal.::	0
"mn015"::	Yep .::	0
"me010"::	The b- the - the double arrow.::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me010"::	So, uh,  yeah,  I mean, it doesn't  magically  make::	0
"me010"::	ambiguity  go away.::	0
"mn015"::	No .::	0
"me010"::	But it  does  say that,::	1
"me010"::	uh, if::	0
"me010"::	you walked into the  cafe  and broke your nose, then you  are  construing the cafe::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	as an  obstacle.::	1
"me010"::	And if that's  not  consistent with::	0
"me010"::	other  things,  then::	0
"me010"::	you've gotta reject that reading.::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me003"::	You con - you conditioned me with your first sentence, and so I thought, "Why would he walk  into  the  cafe  and then::	0
"me003"::	somehow break his nose?" uh,::	0
"me045"::	He slipped on the wet floor.::	0
"me003"::	oh, uh -::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	You don't find that usage, uh - uh, I checked for it in the Brown national corpus. The "walk into it" never really means, w- as in walked smack -::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But "run into" does.::	1
"mn015"::	Yeah, but, y- y- if you find "walked  smacked  into the cafe" or " slammed  into the wall" -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, no,::	0
"me010"::	but " run  into"  does.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Because you will find "run into,"::	0
"me010"::	uh,::	0
"me003"::	Cars run into telephone poles all the time.::	0
"me010"::	well, or "into the  cafe " for that m- you know - "His car ran into the cafe."::	0
"mn015"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah. Or you can run into an old friend, or run.::	0
"me010"::	Well, you can "run into" in  that  sense too.::	0
"me045"::	No!::	0
"me010"::	But, uh,::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, "run into" might even be more impact sense than,::	0
"fe004"::	you know,::	0
"fe004"::	container sense.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Depends.::	0
"me010"::	But - Like, "run into an old friend",::	1
"me010"::	it::	0
"me010"::	probably  needs its own construction.::	1
"me010"::	I mean, uh, you know, George would have I'm sure some exa-::	0
"me010"::	complicated ex- reason why it really was an instance of::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	something else and maybe it is, but,::	0
"me010"::	um, there  are  idioms and my guess is that's  one  of them, but, um - I don't know.::	1
"fe004"::	All contact.::	0
"fe004"::	I mean, there- there's contact that doesn't -  social  contact, whatever. I mean.::	0
"me010"::	Uh.::	0
"me045"::	Sudden surprising contact, right?::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, but it's - it's - it's - it's - Right. i- Yeah, it's more -::	0
"fe004"::	Forceful.::	0
"me045"::	But of course, no, i- i- I mean it has a life of its own. It's sort of partially inspired by the spatial -::	0
"me010"::	Well, this is this motivated - but yeah - oh yeah, mo- for sure,  motivated,  but then::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	you can't  parse  on motivated.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah. Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Too bad.::	0
"me010"::	Uh,::	0
"me003"::	You should get a  T_shirt  that  says  that.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"fe004"::	There's - there's  lots  of things you could make T_shirts out of,  but, uh,::	0
"fe004"::	this has gotten -::	0
"fe004"::	@@::	0
"fe004"::	I mean wh-::	0
"fe004"::	We don't need the words to that.::	0
"mn015"::	Pro- probably not your marks in the kitchen, today. Not - not your marks.::	0
"fe004"::	What?::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, no no no no no no no no no, we're not going there.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"me045"::	In other news.::	0
"me010"::	O_K, so, um,::	0
"me010"::	anything else you want to  ask  us about::	1
"mn015"::	Well,::	0
"me010"::	the thesis proposal, you got -::	1
"me010"::	We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it.::	0
"mn015"::	Well there - actually -::	0
"mn015"::	the - i- what would have been  really  nice is to find an example for::	1
"mn015"::	all  of this,::	0
"mn015"::	uh,::	0
"mn015"::	from our domain.::	1
"mn015"::	So maybe if we w- if we can make one  up    now,  that would be c- incredibly helpful.::	0
"fe004"::	So, w- where it should illustrate::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	How -::	0
"fe004"::	uh - wh- when you say  all  this, do you mean, like, I don't know, the related work stuff, as well as,::	0
"me010"::	Right - right - r-::	0
"fe004"::	mappings?::	0
"mn015"::	w- Well we have, for example, a canonical use of something and y- it's, you know, we have some constructions and then it's construed as something, and then we - we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use::	1
"mn015"::	that's also relevant to the - to the domain.::	1
"me010"::	O_K, f- let's - let's suppose you use "in" and "on".::	0
"me010"::	I mean, that's what you  started  with.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	So "in the bus" and "on the bus," um, that's actually a  little  tricky in English because to  some  extent they're  synonyms.::	1
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	I had two hours w- with George on this, so it, um -::	0
"me010"::	O_K, what did he say.::	0
"fe004"::	Did you?  Join the club.::	0
"me010"::	Right. Oh, h- that's -::	0
"mn015"::	Um.::	0
"mn015"::	"On the bus" is a m- is a metaphorical metonymy::	0
"mn015"::	that relates some meta- path metaphorically and you're on - on that path and::	0
"mn015"::	th- w- I mean it's - he - there's a  platform  notion, right? "he's on the - standing on the bus waving to me." But th- the  regular  as we speak "J- Johno was on the bus to New York," um, uh, he's -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, I - I believe all that, it's just -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	that's, uh, what did I call it here, the transportation schema, something, where you can be on the first flight, on the second flight, and you can be, you know,::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right. So - so that - that may or may not be what you - what you want to do. I mean you  could  do something much simpler::	1
"mn015"::	on the wagon.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	like " under  the bus," or something, where -::	0
"mn015"::	But it's - it's -  unfortunately,  this is not really something a  tourist  would ever  say.::	0
"mn015"::	So.::	0
"me010"::	Well,  unless he was  repairing  it or something, but  yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	But um.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, but O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	So in terms of the - this - We had - we had -  initially  we'd - started discussing the "out of film."::	1
"fe004"::	I see.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	And there's a lot of "out of" analysis, so, um,::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	could we capture  that  with a different construal of -::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, it's a little - it's, uh - we've thought about it before, uh t- uh - to use the examples in other papers, and it's - it's a little complicated.::	1
"me045"::	Out of - out of film, in particular.::	0
"fe004"::	Cuz you're like, it's a state of - there's resource, right, and like,::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	what is film, the state - you know. You're out of the state of having film, right? and somehow film is standing for the re- the resour- the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource.::	0
"me045"::	It's - yeah, I mean, but - and plus the fact that there's also s- I mean, can you say, like,::	0
"fe004"::	I mean.::	0
"fe004"::	It's a little bit -::	0
"me045"::	"The film ran out" you know, or, maybe you could say something like "The film is out" so like the - the film went away from where it  should  be, namely with  you,  or something, right? You know.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, is film the trajector?::	0
"me045"::	The - the film - the film is gone, right? Um,::	0
"me045"::	I never really knew what was going on, I mean I - I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that - that "I'm out of film" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that, but.::	0
"fe004"::	It's weird.::	0
"fe004"::	That -::	0
"me010"::	Uh.::	0
"fe004"::	Or, "having" is also, um, associated with location, right? so if the film  left , you know - state is being near film.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	So running - running out of something is different from being out of somewhere.::	0
"me010"::	Or being out of  something  as, uh - as  well.::	0
"me010"::	So "running out of it" definitely has a  process  aspect to it.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm. But that's from run, yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	So,::	0
"me010"::	b- that's O_K, I mean - b- but the difference::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Is the d- the final  state  of running out of something is being  out  of it.::	0
"me010"::	is -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah. So th-::	0
"me045"::	You  got  there.  You got to  out  of it. Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	That  part is fine.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But, uh -::	0
"me045"::	Hmm!::	0
"me010"::	Yeah,  so - so nob- so no one has in - in - of the,::	0
"me010"::	uh,::	0
"me010"::	professional linguists, they haven't - there was this whole  thesis  on "out of".::	0
"fe004"::	Uh.::	0
"fe004"::	There  was?  Who?::	0
"me010"::	Well, there - I  thought  - or there was a paper on it. Huh?::	0
"me045"::	Out.::	0
"me045"::	There was one on - on "out" or "out of"?::	0
"me010"::	There was a-::	0
"me010"::	Well, it may be just "out". Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	I think there was "over" but there was also a paper on "out".::	0
"me045"::	Yeah, Lind- Susan Lindner, right? The - the - "the syrup spread out"? That kind of thing?::	0
"me010"::	Or something.::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, and all that sort of stuff.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	And undoubtably there's been  reams  of work about it in cognitive linguistics, but.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. But anyway. We're not gonna do that between now and next week.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	So,::	0
"me010"::	um -::	0
"fe004"::	It's not one of the y- it's more straightforward ones - forward ones to defend, so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes - th- these are - you're addressing like, computational linguists, right. Or - are you?::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	There's gonna be four::	0
"mn015"::	computational linguists,::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. But more::	0
"mn015"::	computer-::	0
"fe004"::	emphasis on the computational? Or emphasis on the linguist?::	0
"mn015"::	it's  -::	0
"mn015"::	More - there's going to be the - just four computational linguists, by coincidence, but the rest is, whatever, biocomputing people and physicists.::	0
"me010"::	No no no, but not for your  talk.  I'm- we're worrying about the th- the thes- it's just for one guy.::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Oh, the  thesis!  That's - that's computa- should be very computational, and, uh, someth-::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, I meant  this,  you know, like -::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. So I would try to - I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff.::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	You know, it's an obvious one -  but, uh  -::	0
"me045"::	Totally weird stuff.::	0
"mn015"::	I mean the - the old  bakery  example might be nice, "Is there a  bakery  around here". So if you c- we really just construe it as a -::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Around?::	0
"mn015"::	No, it's the bakery  itself  - is it a building? uh, that you want to go to? or is it something to  eat  that you want to  buy?::	0
"fe004"::	Oh.::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, oh yeah. Yeah, we've thought about that. Right. Right.::	0
"mn015"::	And then -::	0
"fe004"::	Nnn.::	0
"fe004"::	No.   What?  " Bakery " can't be something you're gonna eat.::	0
"me010"::	No, no. The question is d- do you wanna - do you wanna construe - do you wanna constr-strue::	0
"me045"::	Sh-::	0
"me003"::	It's a speech-act.::	0
"me010"::	r- Exactly. It's because do you wanna c- do you want to view::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	the bakery as a p- a place that - that - i- for example, if - y-::	0
"fe004"::	Where you can get baked goods.::	0
"me010"::	Well th- well, that's  one.  You want to  buy  something.::	0
"me010"::	But the  other  is,::	0
"me010"::	uh, yo- you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there'd be a bakery in the neighborhood, or,::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	um, pfff::	0
"me010"::	you know, you wonder how people here make their living, and - there're all sorts of reasons why you might::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	be asking about the existence of a bakery that  doesn't  mean, "I want to buy some  baked  goods."::	1
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	But::	0
"me010"::	um, those are interesting examples but it's not clear that they're  mainly::	1
"me010"::	construal  examples.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	So it's a lot of pragmatics, there, that::	0
"mn015"::	Mmm.::	0
"me010"::	There's all sorts of stuff going on. So::	0
"fe004"::	might be beyond what you want to do.::	0
"me010"::	let's - so let's think about this from the point of view::	0
"me010"::	of construal. So let's first do::	0
"me010"::	a - So the  metonymy  thing::	1
"me010"::	is::	0
"me010"::	probably the  easiest  and a- and actually the -::	1
"me010"::	Though, the one you  have  isn't quite -::	0
"fe004"::	You mean the s-::	0
"fe004"::	You mean "the steak wants to pay"?::	0
"me010"::	N- no not  that  one, that's - that's a - the sort of::	0
"me010"::	background.  This is the t- uh, page five.::	0
"me003"::	About Plato and the book?::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"fe004"::	Oh. Um.::	0
"mn015"::	No.::	0
"me045"::	Onward.::	0
"me010"::	Just beyond that.::	0
"fe004"::	How much does  it  cost?::	0
"mn015"::	Where is the castle? How old is it? How much does it cost?::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	A castle.::	0
"me003"::	Oh.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	To go in, that's like -::	0
"me045"::	Two hundred  million  dollars.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	It's not for sale.::	0
"me010"::	Uh.::	0
"me010"::	So::	0
"me045"::	Yeah, I think that's a good example, actually.::	0
"mn015"::	S-::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, that's good. u-::	0
"mn015"::	But as Nancy just su- suggested it's probably   ellipticus.   Huh.::	1
"fe004"::	Ellipsis.::	0
"fe004"::	Like, " it " doesn't refer to "thing," it refers to acti- you know, j- thing standing for activ- most relevant activity for a tourist - you could think of it that way, but.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Well, shoot, isn't that - I mean, that's what -::	0
"mn015"::	Well,  I mean, my argument  here  is - it's - it's - it's the same thing as "Plato's on the top shelf," I'm con- you know, th- that you can refer to::	1
"me045"::	figuring that out is what this is about.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, yeah, no, I- I agree.::	0
"mn015"::	a book of Plato by using "Plato," and you can::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	No no, I - I'm agreeing that this is a good, um -::	0
"mn015"::	refer back to it, and so you can - Castles have - as tourist sites, have admission fees, so you can say "Where is the castle, how much does it cost?"::	0
"mn015"::	Um.::	0
"mn015"::	"How far is it::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	from here?" So,::	0
"mn015"::	You're also not::	0
"mn015"::	referring to the::	0
"fe004"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	width of the object, or so, www.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Mmm.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. Can we think of a nice::	1
"me010"::	metaphorical  use of "where"::	0
"me010"::	in the tourist's domain?::	1
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"me045"::	Hmm.::	0
"me010"::	So you know it's -::	0
"me010"::	you - you can  sometimes  use " where " f- for " when "::	0
"me045"::	O-::	0
"me010"::	in the sense of, you know,::	0
"me010"::	um,::	0
"me010"::	where - wh- where - where was, um,::	0
"me010"::	"where was Heidelberg, um, in the Thirty Years' War?"::	1
"me010"::	Or something.::	0
"me045"::	Uh, yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	You know, or some such thing.::	0
"me045"::	Like what side were they on, or - ?::	0
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"fe004"::	What?::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. Essentially, yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. I was like, "Huh? It was  here. " Like -  Um.::	0
"me010"::	But anyway th- so there are - there are cases like that. Um,::	0
"fe004"::	Ah!::	0
"fe004"::	Or like its developmental state or something like that, you could - I guess you could get that.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"fe004"::	Um.::	0
"me045"::	I mean, there's also things like - I mean, s- um, I guess::	0
"me045"::	I could ask something like "Where can I find out about blah-blah-blah" in a sort of -::	0
"me045"::	doesn't nece- I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location, just give me a phone number and I'll call them or something like that?::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. There certainly is that, yeah.::	0
"me010"::	You know, "Where could I learn its opening hours," or something.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But that's::	1
"fe004"::	Hmm.::	0
"me010"::	not  metaphorical.::	1
"me010"::	It's another -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So we're thinking about, um,::	0
"me010"::	or we could also think about,::	0
"me010"::	uh -::	0
"mn015"::	Well, I - I - I -::	0
"me010"::	How about "I'm in a hurry"?::	0
"fe004"::	State.::	0
"me010"::	It i- But it's a state - and the - the issue is,::	0
"me045"::	Hmm?::	0
"me010"::	is that - it  may  be just a  usage,::	0
"me010"::	you know, that it's not particularly metaphorical, I don't know.::	0
"me045"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Oh.::	0
"fe004"::	So you want a more exotic one - version of that.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. Yeah, right.::	0
"fe004"::	I'm really into -::	0
"me010"::	Ah! How about::	0
"me010"::	I - I - I - you know, "I'm in - I'm in a state of exhaustion"?::	0
"me010"::	or something like that, which a tourist w- Huh?::	0
"fe004"::	Do you really say that?::	0
"fe004"::	Would you really say that?::	0
"me010"::	A st- uh, well, you can certainly say, um, you know, "I'm in overload."::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me003"::	I- I'm really into art. Uh -::	0
"me010"::	Tu- stur- tourists will often say that.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, I was gonna say, like -::	0
"me010"::	Oh, you can do  that?::	0
"me010"::	Really? Of course that's - that - that's definitely a, uh -::	1
"me045"::	Fixed.::	0
"fe004"::	A fixed expression, yeah.::	1
"me010"::	that's a, uh -::	0
"me010"::	Right. But. -::	0
"fe004"::	There're too - there're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't -  like uh::	0
"fe004"::	"I'm out of sorts now!"::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	1
"fe004"::	Like::	0
"fe004"::	"I'm in trouble!"::	0
"mn015"::	Well I - when, uh - just f- u- the data that I've looked at so far that rec- I mean, there's tons of cases for polysemy.::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	So, you know, mak- re- making reference to buildings as institutions, as containers, as build- you know, whatever.::	0
"fe004"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	1
"mn015"::	Um, so ib- in mus- for example, in museums, you know, as a building or as something where pictures  hang  versus, you know,::	0
"mn015"::	ev- something that puts on exhibits, so forth. But -::	0
"me010"::	Right. As an institution, yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Um.::	0
"fe004"::	Why don't you want to use any of those?::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm?::	0
"fe004"::	So y- you don't wanna use one that's -::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, well - No, but this - that's what I have, you know, started doing.::	0
"me010"::	The castle - the - that old castle one is sort of -::	0
"mn015"::	Metonymy, polysemy.::	0
"me003"::	I love Van Gogh.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Ah!::	0
"fe004"::	"I wanna go see the Van Gogh."::	0
"me045"::	Oh geez.::	0
"fe004"::	Anyway, I'm sorry.::	0
"mn015"::	But I think the argument should be -::	1
"mn015"::	uh, can be made that,::	0
"mn015"::	you know, despite the fact that this is  not  the most met- metaphorical domain, because people interacting with  H_T_I  systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical,::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	construal  still  is, uh, you know, completely,::	0
"mn015"::	um, key in terms of finding out  any  of these things, so,::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	um.::	0
"me010"::	So that's - that's - that's a - that's a reasonable point, that it - in  this  domain you're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy.::	0
"mn015"::	We, uh - I - with a - I looked - with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy.::	0
"me010"::	And polysemy, and stuff like that.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Hardly anything. So not even in  descriptions::	0
"mn015"::	w- did we find anything, um,::	0
"mn015"::	relevant.::	0
"me045"::	I have to go.::	0
"me010"::	Alright. Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	But O_K this is just something we'll - we'll see, um,::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	s- See you.::	0
"mn015"::	and deal with.::	1
"me010"::	O_K, well.::	0
"me010"::	I guess if anybody has additional suggestions, w- Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	I mean maybe the "where is something" question as a  whole,  you know, can be construed as, u- i- locational versus instructional request.::	1
"mn015"::	So, if we're not talk about the lexic-::	0
"fe004"::	Location versus what?::	0
"mn015"::	instruction.::	0
"fe004"::	Instruction. Oh, directions? Yeah. Oh, I thought that was -::	0
"me010"::	Sure.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	definitely treated as an example of construal.::	0
"fe004"::	Right?  @@::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah but then you're not on the lexical level, that's sort of one level higher.::	1
"fe004"::	Oh, you want a lexical example.::	0
"mn015"::	But I don't need it.::	0
"me010"::	Well, you  might  want  both.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Also it  would  be nice to get - ultimately to get a nice mental  space  example, so, even  temporal  references are -::	1
"me010"::	We -::	0
"mn015"::	just in the  spatial  domain are rare.::	1
"me010"::	But it's - it's  easy  to make up  plausible  ones.::	0
"me010"::	You know.::	0
"mn015"::	When - when you're getting  information  on objects. So, I mean -::	0
"me010"::	Right, you know - you know, where r- Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	What color was this in - in::	0
"me010"::	in the nain- nineteenth century. What was this p- instead of - wh- what - you know - how was this painted, what color was this painted, um,::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	was this alleyway open.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, maybe we can include that also in our second, uh, data run. We c- we can show people pictures of objects and then::	1
"me010"::	Uh.::	0
"mn015"::	have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically.::	1
"me010"::	Wish you a good trip.::	0
"me010"::	All success.::	0
"me003"::	For some reason when you said "feedback electronically" I thought of that - you ever see the Simpsons where they're - like the family's got the buzzers::	0
"me003"::	and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying?::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah. That's the -::	0
"fe004"::	first  one, I think. The very very first one.::	0
"me003"::	It was a very early one. I don't know if it's the first one.::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
