"me010"::	but  starting in August, that she's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we'll figure out a way for you - uh - you to get seriously connected with, um::	1

"me010"::	And um -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, I'll say it now. So, um -::	0
"me010"::	And it looks to me like::	1
"me010"::	we're now at a good point to do something - start working on something really  hard.::	1
"me010"::	We've been so far working on things that are easy.::	0
"me045"::	Oh!::	0
"me010"::	Uh, w- Which is::	1
"me010"::	mental spaces and uh -::	0
"me045"::	Hmm!::	0
"me010"::	and-or -::	1
"fe004"::	It's hard.::	0
"me010"::	Huh?::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, it's hard. Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	It's a hard puzzle.  But  the other  part  of it is the way they connect to::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	these, uh, probabilistic relational models.::	1
"me010"::	So  there's  all  the problems that the  linguists  know about, about mental spaces, and the  cognitive  linguists know about, but then there's this problem of the::	1
"me010"::	belief-net  people have only done a  moderately  good job of dealing with  temporal  belief-nets.::	1
"me010"::	Uh, which they call dynamic -::	0
"me010"::	they  incorrectly  call  dynamic  belief-nets. So there's a term " dynamic  belief-net",  doesn't  mean that. It means  time  slices. And Srini used those and people use them.::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
"me010"::	Uh.::	0
"me010"::	But::	0
"me010"::	one of the things I w- would  like  to do over the next, uh, month, it may take more,  is to st- understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them::	1
"me010"::	for multiple worlds::	1
"me010"::	and::	1
"me010"::	uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be, but also what that would translate into in terms of belief-net and the  inferences.::	1
"me010"::	So the  story  is that if you  have  these probabilistic relational  models,  they're set up, in  principle,  so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other, and all that sort of stuff, so it  should  be feasible::	0
"me010"::	to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate  uh,  belief  structure::	0
"me010"::	that they do their inferences with  just  the couplings that::	0
"me010"::	are  appropriate.::	0
"me010"::	But that's g- that's, as far as I can tell, it's - it's putting together two  real  hard problems. One is::	1
"me010"::	the  linguistic  part of::	0
"me010"::	what  are  the couplings and - and when you have a certain, uh, construction, that implies certain couplings and other couplings, you know, between let's say between the past and the present, or any other one of these things::	1
"me010"::	and then we have this  inference  problem of exactly technically how does the belief-net  work::	1
"me010"::	if it's got::	0
"me010"::	um, let's say one in - in, you know, different tenses or my beliefs and  your  beliefs, or any of these other ones of - of multiple models. So::	0
"me010"::	um::	0
"me010"::	you know, in the long run we need to solve  both  of those and my suggestion is that we::	0
"me010"::	start::	0
"me010"::	digging into::	0
"me010"::	them both, uh, in a way we- that, you know, th-  hopefully  turns out to be consistent, so that the -::	0
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"me010"::	And  sometimes  it's actually  easier::	0
"me010"::	to solve two hard problems than  one  because they  constrain  each other. I mean if you've got huge ra- huge range of possible choices::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	um -::	0
"me010"::	We'll  see.  But  anyway,  so that's, um -::	0
"me045"::	Oh yeah, like uh, I solved the - the problem of um - we were talking about how do you -::	0
"me045"::	various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote "count as a noun phrase", you know, occur as an argument of a higher construction, but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way. Um,::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	and it would take a really long time to explain it now, but I'm about to write it up this evening.::	0
"me045"::	I solved that at the same time as "how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase" to get something like "I the kicked dog". Um.::	0
"me010"::	That's great.::	0
"me045"::	Did it - did it at once. So maybe - maybe it'll be a similar thing.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Cool.::	0
"me010"::	No, I know, I th- I- I think that  is  gonna be::	1
"me010"::	sort of::	0
"me010"::	the  key  to this wh- to th- the  big  project of the summer of - of getting the  constructions  right is that::	1
"me010"::	people  do  manage to do this so there probably are some, uh, relatively clean  rules,  they're just not context-free  trees.::	1
"me045"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	And if we - if the formalism is - is  good,  then we should be able to::	0
"me010"::	have, you know, sort of  moderate  scale thing. And that by the way is - is, Keith, what I encouraged George to be::	0

"me010"::	Uh, sorry. In a - in a friendly moment.::	0
"me045"::	Same thing.::	0
"me010"::	Anyway, uh, that we were - that we're gonna try to get a::	1
"me010"::	uh, first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week.::	1
"me010"::	O_K? Probably  skipping  the mental spaces part.::	0
"me045"::	Alright.::	0
"fe004"::	Seems  -::	0
"me045"::	Right.  I do.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, just trying to write up essentially what - what you guys have worked out::	1
"me010"::	so that everybody has something to look at. We've  talked  about it, but only the innermost inner group::	1
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	currently, uh, knows, uh::	0
"me045"::	Knows.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, and - and not even all of them really do. But like -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	There's - The group as a  whole  knows but no individual member kno-::	0
"me010"::	Well that that - yeah th- there's one of the advantages of a document, right?, is - is that::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	it actually transfers from head to head.::	0
"me010"::	So anyway. So um -::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"fe004"::	Ah,  communication!::	0
"me010"::	Huh?::	0
"fe004"::	Communication.::	0
"me010"::	Communication, documentation and stuff.   Anyway,  so, uh, with a little luck -::	0
"me045"::	Hunh!::	0
"me010"::	Uh - l- let's, let's have that as a goal anyway.::	0
"me010"::	And -::	0
"me045"::	So, uh, what was the date there? Monday or - ?::	0
"me010"::	No, no, no.::	0
"me045"::	It's a Friday.::	0
"me010"::	No, w- uh - we're talking about a week fr- e- end of next week.::	0
"fe004"::	But, uh, but - but the  two  of us will probably talk to you at well before th- I mean.::	0
"me045"::	End  of next week. I thought you said beginning  of n-::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Anyway, w- let's talk separately about how t-::	0
"me045"::	Yeah, I have a busy weekend but after that -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah, gung-ho.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. Yeah, so - so someti- sometime next week.::	0
"me045"::	Great,::	0
"me010"::	Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into::	0
"me010"::	some big hole::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	that's fine.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	You know, if you say we're - we're  dump - dump - dump .::	0
"me010"::	There's a  really  hard problem we haven't solved yet - that, that's just fine.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	But at - at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now.::	0
"me010"::	Right, t- t- if - to the extent that we  have  it, let's  write  it::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	and to the extent we  don't,  let's find out what we need to  do.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	So, uh::	0
"mn015"::	Can we - ?::	0
"mn015"::	Is it worth  thinking of an example out of our::	0
"mn015"::	tourism thing domain, that involves a - a - a decent mental  space shift  or setting up -::	0
"me010"::	I think it is, but - uh - but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with::	1
"me010"::	"where is the Powder-Tower?" or whatever::	1
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Well.::	0
"me045"::	Uh, what was  supposed  to happen? I've sort of been actually caught up in some  other  ones, so, um, you know, I don't have a write-up of -::	0
"me045"::	or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about which were -::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm, yeah. I think - I think we already  came::	0
"mn015"::	to the conclusion that we have two alternative  paths that we -::	0
"mn015"::	two alternative ways of representing it. One is sort of a - has a::	0
"mn015"::	um::	0
"me045"::	It's gone.::	0
"mn015"::	um::	0
"me045"::	The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic.::	1
"fe004"::	One of them was th-::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	or comes - is resolved::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	later. Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	I think it has to be the - the second case.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Um, so d'you - Is it clear what we're talking about here?::	0
"fe004"::	I agree.::	0
"me010"::	Uh -::	0
"me045"::	The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path. Um::	1
"mn015"::	It's -::	0
"fe004"::	So you might be - yeah, y-::	1
"fe004"::	And asking for directions.::	1
"mn015"::	Should we have a - a - a -::	0
"me045"::	or - or whether the construction semantically, uh, is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning "tell me how to get there".::	1
"fe004"::	Uh -::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	So  assume these are two, uh, nodes we can observe in the Bayes-net. So these are either::	0
"me010"::	Yep.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	true or false and it's also just true  or false.::	0
"mn015"::	If we encounter a phrase such as "where is X_?", should that set  this  to true  and  this to true, and the Bayes-net figures out which under the c- situation in general is more  likely?::	0
"mn015"::	Um, or should it just activate::	0
"mn015"::	this,  have this be  false,  and the Bayes-net figures out whether this  actually  now means - ?::	0
"me010"::	Uh w- that's a s- O_K, so that's a - that's a  separate  issue. So I a- I I th- I agree with you that, um, it's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every::	1
"fe004"::	Slightly different.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	uh, pragmatic::	0
"me010"::	reading, although there are  some  that will need to  be  there.::	1
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Good.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	I mean, there- there's some that -::	0
"fe004"::	Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one.  Right.::	0
"me010"::	You can't do that either. Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But, you know, c- um - almost certainly "can you pass the salt" is a construction worth::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	noting that there is this th- this - this - this - uh::	0
"fe004"::	Request.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm. Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Very  yeah.::	0
"me045"::	So right, this one is maybe in the gray area. Is it - is it like  that  or is it just sort of::	0
"me010"::	Ri-::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	One::	0
"me045"::	obvious from world knowledge that no one - you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever.::	0
"mn015"::	Or in some cases, it's - it's quite  definitely  s- so that you  just  know - wanna know::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	where it is.::	0
"me045"::	Well the question is basically, is this conventional or conversational implicature?::	1
"me010"::	Exactly. Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Might be, yeah.::	0
"me010"::	And I guess, see, the more  important  thing at  this  stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei-::	0
"me010"::	f- in the  short  run it's more important to know::	1
"me010"::	how we would treat -::	0
"me010"::	technically what we would do if we decided A_ and what we would do if we decided B_, than it is t- to decide A_ or B_ r-::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	O_K, right.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Which one it is.::	0
"me045"::	Which of that is.  Yeah, O_K::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm.::	0
"me010"::	right  now.::	1
"fe004"::	Cuz there will be other k- examples that are one way or the other. Right.::	0
"me010"::	W- we know for  sure  that we have to be able to do  both.  So I guess::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	In the  short  run, let's - let's::	0
"me010"::	be  real  clear on h-::	0
"me010"::	what the two alternatives would  be.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	And then the-  we had another idea floating around::	0
"mn015"::	um, which we wanted to, uh, get your input on, and that concerns the -::	0
"mn015"::	But the  nice  thing is w- we  would  have a person that would like to  work  on it, and that's Ir- Irina  Gurevich   from E_M_L  who is going to be visiting us, uh, the week before, uh, August::	1
"mn015"::	and a little bit into August.::	0
"mn015"::	And she would like to  apply the  ontology that is, um::	1
"mn015"::	being crafted at E_M_L. That's not the one I sent you. The one I sent you was from G_M_D, out of a European CRUMPET.::	1
"me010"::	It was terrible.::	0
"mn015"::	Agreed.::	0
"mn015"::	Um, and one of the reas- one of the - those ideas was,::	0
"mn015"::	so,::	0
"mn015"::	back to the old Johno observation that if y- if you have a dialogue history  and it said::	1
"mn015"::	the word " admission  fee"::	0
"mn015"::	was::	0
"mn015"::	uh, mentioned::	0
"mn015"::	um, it's more likely that the person actually wants to  enter   than just take a picture of it::	1
"mn015"::	from the outside.::	0
"mn015"::	Now what  could  imagine - to, you know, have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history, yeah? That's the  really  stupid way.::	0
"mn015"::	Then there is the  really  clever  way that was suggested by  Keith   and then there is the, uh,  middle  way that  I'm  suggesting  and that is you - you  get   X_ , which is whatever, the castle.::	1
"mn015"::	The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours, that they have admission fees, they have whatever.::	1
"mn015"::	And then, this is - We go via a thesaurus::	0
"mn015"::	and look up  certain linguistic surface structures  that are related to these concepts  and feed  those  through the dialogue history and check dynamically::	1
"mn015"::	for each e- entity. We look it up::	1
"mn015"::	check whether any of these were mentioned::	0
"mn015"::	and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse::	0
"mn015"::	side.::	1
"mn015"::	But Keith suggested that a - a much cleaner way would be -  is,   you know, to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you - if you  know  that something like that ha- has been mentioned  before,  this just a- continues to add up, you know, in th- in a -::	1
"me045"::	So if someone mentions admission f- fees, that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep- in the representation of what's being talked about. And then when someone asks "where is X_?" you've already got the - the Enter schema activated and you're able to - to conclude on it. Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Kind of a priming::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	priming a spreading activation::	1
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. So that's certainly  more  realistic. I m- I mean  psychologically.  Now  technically::	0
"me045"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Um::	0
"me003"::	Well, uh, is it - doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a - a thread, that::	0
"me003"::	you know, kept track of ho- of the activity of -::	0
"me003"::	I mean, cuz it would - the - the thread would know what nodes  like, needed to be activated, so it could just keep track of  how long it's been since  something's been mentioned, and  automatically load it in.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	You  could  do that. Um.::	0
"me010"::	But::	0
"me010"::	here's - here's a way - in th- in the bl-  Bayes-net  you could - you could  think  about it this way, that if::	1
"me010"::	um  at the time "admissions fee" was mentioned  you could increase the probability  that someone wanted to  enter.::	1
"fe004"::	Turn prior on .::	0
"me003"::	We- yeah - th- th- that's what I wa- I wasn't - I was -::	0
"me003"::	I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas. I was just -::	0
"me010"::	Fair enough, O_K, but, but, in terms of the c- c- the current implementation - right?::	0
"me010"::	so that::	0
"me010"::	um::	0
"fe004"::	It would already be higher in the  context.::	0
"me010"::	th- that th- the - the - the conditional probability that someone -::	0
"me010"::	So at the time you  mentioned  it -::	0
"me010"::	This is - this is essentially the Bayes-net equivalent::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	of the spreading activation. It's -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	In some ways it's not as good but it's  the implementation we  got.  We don't  have  a connectionist implementation.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah, sure. No, I mean::	0
"me010"::	Now -::	0
"me010"::	Now my  guess  is that it's  not  a question of time but it::	0
"me010"::	is a question of whether another  intervening object has been  mentioned.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, relevance. Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	I mean, we could look at dialo- this is - Of course the  other  thing we ha- we do is, is we have this data coming::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	which probably will blow all our theories, but -  but skipping that - so - so - but my guess is what - what'll  probably  will happen,::	1
"me045"::	Yeah, right.::	0
"me010"::	Here's a - here's a proposed design.::	0
"me010"::	is that there're certain constructions which, uh, for our purposes do::	0
"me010"::	change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds::	1
"me010"::	and::	0
"me010"::	th- that::	1
"me010"::	the, uh,  standard  way that - that the- these contexts work is sort of stack-like or whatever, but that's sort of the most recent  thing.::	1
"me010"::	And so it  could  be that  when another::	1
"me010"::	uh, en- tourist entity gets mentioned, you::	1
"fe004"::	Renew   @@  Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	re- re- essentially re-initiali- you know, re-i- essentially re-initialize the  state.::	1
"me003"::	Mmm.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	And of course i- if we had a  fancier  one with multiple worlds::	1
"me010"::	you could have - uh, you could keep track of what::	0
"me010"::	someone was  uh::	0
"me010"::	saying about this and that. You know, "I wanna go - in the morning I wanna -"::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	"Here's my plan for today. Here's my plan for tomorrow." hypothetically.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, or - Yeah, in the morning morning I- I'm planning t- to go shopping, in the afternoon to the Powder-Tower -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, tal- so I'm talking about  shopping  and then you say, uh, you know, well, um::	0
"me010"::	"What's it cost?" or something. Or -  Anyway.  So one could well imagine, but not  yet.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But I  do  th- think that the -::	0
"me010"::	It'll turn out that it's gonna be - depend pretty much on whether there's been an override.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, I mean, if - if you ask "how much does a train ride and - and cinema around the vineyards cost?" and then somebody tells you it's sixty dollars and then you say::	0
"mn015"::	"O_K::	0
"mn015"::	How much is, uh - I would like to  visit the -"  whatever, something completely different, "then I go to, you know, Point Reyes",::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	it - it's  not  more likely that you want to enter  anything,  but it's, as a matter of fact, a complete  rejection  of entering::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	by doing that.::	0
"fe004"::	So when you admit- have admission fee and it changes something, it's only for that particular - It's relational, right? It's only for that particular object.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, I th- th- Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Well, and - and - and the  simple  idea is that it's on- it's only for m- for the current::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	uh, tourist e- entity of  instre-   interest.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah. But that's -::	0
"mn015"::	I mean this - this function,::	0
"mn015"::	so, has the current object been mentioned in -::	0
"mn015"::	in - with a question about -::	0
"me010"::	No, no. It's - it -::	0
"me010"::	It goes the other d- it goes in the other direction.::	0
"mn015"::	concerning its -::	0
"me010"::	Is -::	0
"me010"::	When th- When the - this is  mentioned,   the::	0
"me010"::	uh::	0
"me010"::	probability of - of, let's say, entering changes-::	0
"fe004"::	Of  that  object.::	0
"me010"::	changes.::	0
"fe004"::	For - But - Right.::	0
"me003"::	You could just hav- uh, just basically, ob- it -::	0
"me003"::	It observes an - er, it sets the - a node for::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me003"::	"entered" or "true" or something, "discourse enter".::	0
"me010"::	Now, uh - But I think Ro- Robert's  right,  that to  determine  that,::	1
"me010"::	O_K? you may well want to go through a th- thesaurus and - and -::	1
"me010"::	So, if the issue is, if - so now th- this construction has been matched and you say "O_K.::	1
"me010"::	Does  this actually  have  any  implications  for our  decisions? "::	0
"me010"::	Then there's another piece of code::	0
"me010"::	that presumably   does  that  computation.::	1
"fe004"::	So, sort of forward chaining in a way, rather than  backward. O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But - but what's  Robert's  saying is - is,::	0
"me010"::	and I think he's  right,::	0
"me010"::	is you  don't  want to try to build into the construction  itself::	0
"me010"::	all the synonyms and all - you know, all the wo-::	0
"me010"::	Uh::	0
"me010"::	maybe.::	0
"me010"::	I'll have to  think  about  that.::	0
"fe004"::	Hmm.::	0
"me010"::	I don't know.::	0
"me010"::	I mean it - th-::	1
"me010"::	I can thi- I can think of arguments in either direction on that.  But  somehow  you want to do it.::	1
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	Well, it's just another, sort of, construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history::	0
"mn015"::	or changing of the  probabilities, and-or -::	0
"fe004"::	Guess it's like - I g- The other thing is, whether you have a m-::	0
"fe004"::	m- user model::	0
"fe004"::	that has, you know, whatever, a current plan,::	0
"fe004"::	whatever,::	0
"fe004"::	plans that had been discussed, and::	0
"fe004"::	I don't know, I mean -::	0
"me003"::	What - uh, what's the argument for putting it  in  the construction? Is it just that  the s- synonym selection is better, or - ?::	1
"me010"::	Oh, wel-::	0
"me010"::	Well, the ar- the - The argument is that::	0
"me010"::	you're gonna have the -::	0
"me010"::	If you've recognized the word,::	0
"me010"::	you've recognized the  word,  which means you have a  lexical   construction for it, so you could just as well tag::	1
"me010"::	the lexical construction with the fact that it's a::	0
"me010"::	uh, you know, thirty percent increase in::	0
"me010"::	probability of  entering.::	1
"me010"::	You - So you could - you could - you could invert -  invert  the whole thing, so you s- you tag  that  information on to  the lexicon since you::	0
"me003"::	Mmm.::	0
"me003"::	Oh,  I  see.::	0
"me010"::	had to recognize it  anyway.::	0
"me010"::	That  - that's the argument in the other direction.::	0
"me010"::	at - at -::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, and this is -::	0

"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Because  it's a little different. We had to - we had an idea for this which seemed like it would  probably  work.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, now, we- we w-::	0
"me010"::	Great. O_K. Yeah. Simspec may need - we may n- need to re-name that.::	0
"fe004"::	I - Yeah. I -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	O_K? So let's think of a name for - for whatever the - this intermediate structure is. Oh, we talked about  semspec,  for "semantic spec- specification" and that seems -::	1

"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0

"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	And, yeah, we absolutely need to find -::	0
"me010"::	Part  of what was  missing  were markings of all  sorts  that weren't in there, incl- including the questions - We didn't - we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis::	1
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	in - in::	0
"me010"::	uh, the semspec.::	1
"fe004"::	Yeah, we've talked a little bit about  that, too, which -::	0
"fe004"::	uh, uh, it's hard for me to figure out with  sort of  our general linguistic issues, how they map onto this particular one, but -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K, yeah, understood.::	0
"me010"::	But that's part of the formalism - is got to be::	0
"me010"::	uh, how things like that get marked.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	W- do you have data, like the - the -::	0
"fe004"::	You have preliminary  data? Cuz I know, you know, we've been using this one easy sentence::	0
"fe004"::	and I'm sure you guys have - uh, maybe you are the one who've been looking at  the rest of it - it'd - it'd be useful for me, if we want to  have it a little bit more::	0
"me045"::	Um, I-::	0
"me045"::	To tell you the truth, what I've been looking at has not been the data so far, I just sort of said "alright let's see if I can get noun phrases and, uh, major verb co- uh, constructions out of the way first."::	0
"fe004"::	data oriented.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm  mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	And I have  not  gotten them out of the way yet. Surprise. So, um.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	So, I have not really approached a lot of the data, but I mean obviously like these - the - the question one, since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that, you know, I ca- can try and, um::	1
"me045"::	run with  that,  you know, try and do some of the sentence constructions now. It would make sense.::	1
"mn015"::	O_K. Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry?::	1
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"me045"::	Oh yeah, the basic idea is that um,::	0
"me045"::	uh  you know - Uh,  let's see  if I can  formulate this.::	0
"mn015"::	So  Mary fixed the car with a wrench.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	So you  perform the mental sum  and then, you know, " who  fixed the car with a wrench?"::	1
"mn015"::	You  basically are told, to - to do this::	0
"mn015"::	In the - in - analogously to the way you would do " someone  fixed the car with a wrench". And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out  what that, you know,::	1
"me045"::	Means.::	0
"mn015"::	means, and then  come up with that - so  who  that someone was.::	1
"me045"::	The W_H question has this as sort of extra thing which says "and when you're done, tell me who fills that slot" or w- you know. So, um.::	1
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	And, you know, this is sort of a nice way to do it, the idea of sort of saying that you treat - from the simulation point of view or whatever - you treat, uh, W_H constructions similarly to::	1
"me045"::	uh, indefinite pronouns like "someone fixed the car" because  lots of languages, um, have W_H questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever, and you just get intonation to tell you that it's a question.::	1
"fe004"::	Use actually the same one.::	0
"me010"::	Alright, which is::	0
"me045"::	So it makes sense  um::	0
"me010"::	Skolemization.::	1
"me045"::	Hmm?::	0
"me010"::	In - in logic, it's - it's -  @@   it's actual- Huh? What?::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.  Let's put a Skolem -  Skolem constant in, yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0

"fe004"::	Yeah.  Right.::	0

"me010"::	That- that's not - that's not saying it's  bad,  it's just that -::	0
"me045"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Right. No. Of course.::	0
"me010"::	that - that - the logicians have - have, uh -::	0
"fe004"::	Mmm.::	0
"me045"::	That's right.::	0
"mn015"::	come up with this::	1
"me045"::	It makes sense from that point of view, too, which is actually better. So yeah, um.::	0
"me045"::	Anyway, but just that kind of thing and we'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on, but::	1
"me010"::	Good.::	0
"me045"::	Uh, no, all the focus stuff. We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know, like, what we were talking about  exactly, what the object of study was. So.::	1
"fe004"::	Um-mmm.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. Well, if - if - I mean, i- part of - of what the exercise is, t- by the end of next week, is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	That's fine. I mean::	0
"me045"::	Yep.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	Well, if you - if you::	0
"mn015"::	do  wanna discuss focus  background::	0
"mn015"::	and then::	0
"mn015"::	get  me  into that because - I mean, I wo- I w- scientifically worked on that for - for almost two years.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	O_K, then certainly we will. Good.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, you should definitely, um::	0
"fe004"::	be on on that - maybe - maybe by - after Monday we'll - y- you can see what things we are and aren't -::	0
"me045"::	Yeah. w- We should figure out what our questions are, for example,  to ask you. So.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"me045"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Wel- then- t- Hans.::	0
"me010"::	Has - I haven't seen Hans Boas?::	1
"fe004"::	He's  been around.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. So has he been - been involved with this, or - ?::	0
"fe004"::	Just maybe not today.::	0
"fe004"::	Eh. with us? Yeah. I would say that tha- that those discussions have been primarily, um, Keith and - Keith and  me,  but um::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	like in th- the meeting - I mean, he sort of - I thin- like the  last  meeting we had, I think we were all very much part of it  but  um::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a  devil's advocate type role or something,  like  "This make - you know, I'm going to pretend I'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this. This makes no sense." And he'll just go off on parts of it which  definitely need fixing but aren't where we're  at  right now, so it's::	1
"fe004"::	but different perspec- Yeah.::	1
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Like - like what you  call  certain things, which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"fe004"::	But in a sense, it's good to know that he  of all people - you know, like maybe a lot of people would have m- much stronger reactions, so, you know, he's like a relatively friendly linguist and  yet  a word like "constraint" causes a lot of problems.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. This is consistent with::	1
"fe004"::	And, so.  Right. So.::	0
"me010"::	um::	0
"me010"::	the role I had suggested that he - he  play,::	1
"fe004"::	Ah.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	O_K, which was  that::	1
"me010"::	o- one of the things I would like to see happen::	0
"me010"::	is a paper that was tentatively called "Towards a formal cognitive semantics"::	1
"me010"::	which was addressed to::	1
"me010"::	these linguists  uh  who haven't been following  this stuff at all.::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So  it  could  be that he's actually, at some level, thinking about how am I going to  communicate this story -::	1
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So,  internally,  we should just do  whatever works, cuz it's hard enough.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	But  if he g- if he turns - is - is really gonna turn around and help t- to write this version that::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	does   connect with as many as possible of the  other linguists in the world::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	um::	0
"me010"::	then -::	0
"me010"::	then  it becomes important to  use::	0
"me010"::	terminology that::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.  Sure.::	0
"me010"::	doesn't::	0
"me010"::	make it  hard  - I mean, it's gonna be  plenty  hard for - for people to understand it as it is, but y- y- you don't want to make it  worse.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So.::	0
"me045"::	No, right. I mean, tha- that role is - is, uh, indispensable but that's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings. It was a little strange.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, yeah. - No, that's fine. I just wanted t- to::	0
"me010"::	I have to catch up with  him,  and I wanted t- to get a feeling for that. O_K.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me045"::	So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly, you know.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Good.::	0
"me045"::	Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we're talking a bunch of goobledy-gook from his point of view.::	0
"fe004"::	I think it's good when we're -::	0
"fe004"::	when we're into  data  and looking at the - some specific linguistic phenomenon  in - in English or in  German,  in particular, whatever,::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	that's  great,  and Ben and - and Hans are, if - if anything,  more  - you know, they have  more  to say than, let's say, I would about some of these things.::	1
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	But when it's like, well, w- how do we  capture  these things, you know, I think it's definitely been Keith and I who have d- you know, who have worried more about the -::	1
"me010"::	Well, that's good. That's - I- I- I think that  should  be the -::	0
"me045"::	Mm-hmm.::	0

"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	the core group  and  um::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	that's, you know, I think   very  close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Yes.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah . We actually  have  - I think we  have  been making progress, and its sort of surprising. You know, like -::	0
"me010"::	I - I - I - I  definitely  get that impression. Yeah. That's great.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me045"::	Yep.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	So anyone else would like uh  ruin the balance of -  Anyway.::	0
"me010"::	Well, but -  Well.  But th- th- then w- then we have to come  back  to the bigger group.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"me045"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.   Great. And then we're gon- we're gonna - because of this  other  big thing we haven't talked about is  actually implementing this stuff?::	0
"me010"::	So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah, we could talk tomorrow.::	0
"fe004"::	I was just gonna say, though, that, for instance, there was - you know, out of a meeting with Johno::	1
"fe004"::	came the suggestion that " oh,::	0
"fe004"::	could it be that the  meaning  constraints really  aren't  used for selection?" which has sort of been implicit  in the parsing  strategy we talked about. In which case we w- we can just say that they're the  effects  or the  bindings.::	1
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Which  uh,  so  far, in terms of like putting up all the constraints as, you know, pushing them into  type  constraints, the - when I've, you know, propo- then proposed it to linguists who  haven't  yet given me - you know, we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work.::	1
"fe004"::	Right? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably  complex.::	1
"me010"::	Well, it -::	0
"fe004"::	So -  Anyway,  to be - to talk about later.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, it  has  to in the sense that::	0
"me010"::	you're gonna use them eventu- it's - you know, it's sort of a, um, generate and  test::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	kind of thing, and if you  over-generate  then you'll have to do more. I mean, if there are  some  constraints that you hold back and don't use::	1
"me010"::	uh, in your initial matching::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	then you'll match some things - I mean, I - I d- I don't think there's any way that it could  completely  fail. It - it could be that::	0
"me010"::	uh, you wind up - I mean -::	0
"me010"::	The original  bad  idea of purely context-free grammars::	0
"me010"::	died because  there were just  vastly  too many parses.::	0
"me010"::	You know,  exponentially  num- num- many parses. And so th- the  concern  might be that - not that it would  totally  fail, but that -::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	That it would  still  generate too many.::	0
"me010"::	it would still genera-::	0
"fe004"::	Right? So by  just  having semantic- even bringing semantics in for matching  just  in the form of j- semantic types, right? Like::	0
"fe004"::	"conceptually these have to be construed as this, this, and this"::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	might  still  give us quite a few possibilities::	0

"fe004"::	it certainly helps a lot. I mean, le- let's put it that way. So.::	0
