"fe016"::	That's  looks  strange.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, now we're on and it seems to be working.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh there we go.::	0
"mn005"::	One two three four five six::	0
"fe008"::	This looks good.::	0
"me018"::	That is weird.::	0
"me018"::	It's like when it's been sitting for a long time or something.::	0
"me011"::	So, I mean -::	0
"me011"::	I don't know  what  it is.::	0
"me011"::	But all - all I know is that it seems like every time I::	0
"me011"::	am up here  after  a meeting,::	0
"me011"::	and I start it,::	0
"me011"::	it works fine.::	0
"me011"::	And if I'm up here and I start it and we're all sitting here waiting to have a  meeting,  it::	0
"me011"::	gives me that  error  message and I have not yet sat down with -::	0
"me011"::	been able to get that  error  message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it's occurring in the  code.::	0
"me018"::	Next time you get it maybe we should write it down.::	0
"me011"::	Yep, we will.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Was it a pause, or - ?::	0
"me011"::	One of these days.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K. Was it on "pause"::	0
"fe008"::	or something?::	0
"me011"::	No.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Don't know.::	0
"me013"::	So uh - so the uh,::	0
"me013"::	the new procedural change that just got suggested, which I think is a good idea is that um,::	0
"me013"::	we do the digit recordings at the  end.::	0
"me013"::	And that way, if we're recording somebody else's uh meeting,::	0
"me013"::	and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time,::	0
"me013"::	uh, then they can run off.::	0
"me013"::	It'll mean we'll get somewhat fewer::	0
"me013"::	uh, sets of digits, but um, I think that way we'll::	0
"me013"::	cut into people's time, um,::	0
"me013"::	if someone's on strict time::	0
"me013"::	uh, less.::	0
"me013"::	So, I th- I think - I think we should start doing that.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	so, uh, let's see, we were having a discussion the other day,::	0
"me013"::	maybe we should bring that up,::	0
"me013"::	about uh, the nature of the data that we are collecting.::	0
"me013"::	uh::	0
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	that uh, we should have a fair amount of data that is::	0
"me013"::	um, collected for the same meeting,::	0
"me013"::	so that we can, uh -::	0
"me013"::	I don't know. Wh- what - what were some of the points again about that?::	0
"me013"::	Is it -::	0
"fe016"::	Uh, well, O_K, I'll back up.  Um, at the previous - at last week's meeting,  this  meeting::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	I was griping::	0
"fe016"::	about wanting to get more data and I - I talked about this with Jane and::	0
"fe016"::	Adam, um, and was thinking of::	0
"fe016"::	this mostly just so that we could do research::	0
"fe016"::	on this data::	0
"fe016"::	um, since we'll have a new - this new student di- does wanna work with us,  th- the guy that was at the last meeting.::	0
"me018"::	Well, great.::	0
"me018"::	Great.::	0
"fe016"::	And he's already funded part-time, so we'll only be paying him for sort of for  half  of the normal part-time,::	0
"me018"::	What a deal.::	0
"fe016"::	uh -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And what's he interested in, specifically?::	0
"fe016"::	So::	0
"fe016"::	he's - comes from a signal-processing background, but I liked him a lot cuz he's very interested in::	0
"fe016"::	higher  level things, like language, and::	0
"fe016"::	disfluencies and all kinds of eb-::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	maybe prosody,  so he's just getting his feet wet in that.::	0
"me011"::	Great.::	0
"fe016"::	Anyway, I thought O_K, maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts -::	0
"fe016"::	he'd be starting in::	0
"fe016"::	January, next semester::	0
"fe016"::	that we'd have, you know, enough data to work with.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	But, um, Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that::	0
"fe016"::	just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m- you need to make sure that the speakers::	0
"fe016"::	are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want, and so forth.::	0
"fe016"::	So, I thought about that and I think it's still possible, um,::	1
"fe016"::	but I'd rather try to get more regular meetings of::	0
"fe016"::	types that we know about,  and hear , then sort of a::	0
"fe016"::	mish-mosh of a bunch of one -::	0
"fe016"::	one-time -::	1
"me011"::	One offs?::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, just because it would be very hard to::	0
"fe016"::	process the data in all senses, both::	0
"fe016"::	to get the,::	0
"fe016"::	um -::	0
"fe016"::	to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it, like::	0
"fe016"::	well, I was talking to Morgan about::	0
"fe016"::	things like summarization, or what's this meeting about.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean::	0
"fe016"::	it's very different if you have a group that's just::	0
"fe016"::	giving a report on what they did that week, versus coming to a decision and so forth. So.::	1
"fe016"::	Then I was um, talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area,::	0
"fe016"::	sort of a  separate  issue from what the student would be working on::	0
"fe016"::	where::	0
"fe016"::	I was thinking of doing::	0
"fe016"::	some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues::	0
"fe016"::	in both the::	0
"fe016"::	utterances  and  in the::	0
"fe016"::	utterance patterns,  like in::	1
"fe016"::	numbers of overlaps and amount of speech,::	1
"fe016"::	sort of raw cues::	1
"fe016"::	from the interaction that can be measured from::	0
"fe016"::	the signals and from the diff-::	0
"fe016"::	different microphones::	0
"fe016"::	that point to::	0
"fe016"::	sort of hot spots in the meeting, or things where stuff is going on that might be important::	0
"fe016"::	for someone who didn't attend to   listen  to.::	1
"fe016"::	And in  that::	1
"fe016"::	uh, regard, I thought we definitely w- will need -::	0
"fe016"::	it'd b- it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data::	0
"fe016"::	from a few different domains, or a few different kinds of meetings. So this - this meeting is one of them, although I'm not sure I can participate if I -::	1
"fe016"::	You know, I would feel very strange being  part  of a meeting that you were then analyzing later for things like summarization.::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Um, and then there are some others that menti- that Morgan mentioned, like the front-end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	So -::	1
"me011"::	Yeah, we're - we're  hoping  that they'll let us start recording regularly. So.::	0
"fe016"::	So if that were the case then I think we'd have enough. But basically, for anything where you're trying to get::	1
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	a summarization of some kind of meeting -    meaning  out of the meeting, um,::	0
"fe016"::	it would be too hard to have::	0
"fe016"::	fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize, but -::	1
"fe016"::	rather we should have::	0
"fe016"::	different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.::	1
"fe016"::	And then we need a couple that - of -  We don't wanna just have  one  group because that might be specific to that particular group, but::	0
"fe016"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	S- So -::	0
"fe016"::	three or four different kinds.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the::	0
"me011"::	morning  meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	See, I've never listened to the data for the front-end  meeting.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, we - we've only had  three.  So.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	But maybe that's enough. So, in general, I was thinking more data but also::	1
"fe016"::	data where we hold some parameters::	0
"fe016"::	constant or fairly similar,  like a meeting about::	1
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	of people doing a certain kind of::	0
"fe016"::	work where at least half the participants each time are the same.::	1
"me011"::	Um -::	0
"me013"::	Now, let - l- l- let me just::	0
"me013"::	give you the other side to that cuz I ca- because I - I don't disagree with that,::	0
"me013"::	but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, for  other  kinds of research,::	0
"me013"::	particularly the  acoustic  oriented research,::	0
"me013"::	I actually feel the opposite need.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	I'd like to have lots of different people.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	As many people here a- a- and talking about the kind of thing that::	0
"me013"::	you were just talking about::	0
"me013"::	it would have uh too few people from my point of view. I'd like to have many different speakers.::	0
"me013"::	So, um::	0
"me013"::	I think I would  also  very much like us to have a fair amount of  really  random scattered meetings, of somebody coming down from campus, and -::	0
"mn005"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	and uh, I mean, sure, if we can::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	get  more  from them, fine, but if we only get one or  two  from each group,::	0
"me013"::	that  still  could be useful  acoustically  just because we'd have::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, I definitely agree with that. Definitely.::	0
"me013"::	close and distant microphones with different people.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Can I - can I say about that - that the - the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers.::	0
"fe008"::	Because I think if you just say - an- And in particular, my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because::	0
"fe008"::	there you'd have so- people who'd have proficiency enough in English that -::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	that uh, it would be useful for - for purposes - You know.::	0
"fe008"::	But you know, I think::	0
"fe008"::	I've been - I've I - I've gathered data from undergrads at - on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you'd get  such  a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you'd have at all.::	0
"me013"::	Well, you want to i-::	0
"fe008"::	And - and the English you'd have - The language models would be really hard to build because it would not really be - it would be an  interlanguage  rather than  than a -::	0
"me013"::	Well,::	0
"me013"::	O_K, uh, first place, I - I - I don't think we'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another, I think::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I - I think that's what we're::	0
"me013"::	investigating, so::	0
"fe016"::	It has to be a -::	1
"fe016"::	a pre-existing meeting,  like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway. That's I think what we - and I agree with.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah,::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	yeah.::	0
"me011"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	So I was -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, interesting!::	0
"me013"::	uh, and - and - and uh, senior uh, uh, d- and::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	uh, doctoral students who are leading projects::	0
"me013"::	and offering to them::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, I see.::	0
"me013"::	that they have their - hold their meeting down here.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, interesting!::	0
"me013"::	Uh, that's the first point. The second point is::	0
"me013"::	um::	0
"me013"::	I think that for some time now, going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non-native accents::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, oh. I'm not saying  accents.::	0
"me013"::	and I th- I think that -::	0
"fe008"::	u- The accent's not the problem.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	No, it's more a matter of uh,  proficiency,::	0
"fe008"::	e- e- just simply  fluency.::	0
"fe008"::	I mean, I deal with people::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	on - on campus who -::	0
"fe008"::	I think sometimes people,::	0
"fe008"::	undergraduates um in  computer  science::	0
"fe008"::	uh, have language skills that make, you know - that their - their fluency and writing skills::	0
"fe008"::	are not so strong.::	0
"me013"::	Oh! You're not talking about foreign language at  all.  You're just talking about -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah. Yeah, just talking about.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, e- I just think, but you know, it's like when you get into the graduate level,::	0
"me011"::	We all had the same thought.::	0
"fe008"::	uh, no problem.::	0
"fe008"::	I mean, I'm not saying accents. I'm say- I'm saying fluency. Well, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, then we're  completely  gone. It's -::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	The - the habits are already burnt in. But -::	0
"fe008"::	I'm just saying fluency.::	0
"me011"::	Well, I think that, um -::	0
"me011"::	I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And - and I think::	0
"me011"::	if it's a pre-existing meeting and it's held in English,::	0
"me011"::	I - I think it's probably O_K if a few of the people don't have::	0
"me011"::	uh, g-  particularly  good English skills.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, now can I - can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that::	0
"fe008"::	um, there's - there's this - this issue, you have a corpus out there, it should be used for - for multiple things cuz it's so expensive to put together.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	And if people want to approach -::	0
"fe008"::	Um, i- so I know  e- e-::	0
"fe008"::	You know this - The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group,::	0
"me013"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	but the idea of language models, which are fund- you know::	0
"fe008"::	generally speaking uh, you know, t- t- terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	or an hour invested in preparing the data,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	if you have a choice between people who are::	0
"fe008"::	pr- more proficient in -::	0
"fe008"::	um,::	0
"fe008"::	i- more fluent, more - more::	0
"fe008"::	close to being academic English, then it would seem to me to be a  good  thing.::	0
"me013"::	I guess - I- maybe - Hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Because otherwise y- you don't have the ability to have -::	0
"me013"::	I-::	0
"fe008"::	Uh, so if - if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case. If you have people who are using English as a - as an interlanguage because they - they don't -::	1
"fe008"::	uh, they can't speak in their  native  languages and -::	0
"fe008"::	but their interlanguage isn't::	0
"me013"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	really a match to any existing,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, language model,::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	this is the  worst  case scenario.::	0
"me013"::	Well, that's pretty much what you're going to have in the  networking  group.::	0
"fe008"::	And -::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	because - because they - most - the network group is almost entirely Germans and  Spaniards.::	0
"fe008"::	Well I-::	0
"fe008"::	Oh.::	0
"fe008"::	But the thing is, I think that these people are of high enough level in their - in their language proficiency that -  And I'm not objecting to  accents.   I - I'm - I'm just thinking that we have to think at a - at a higher level view, could we have a language model, a - a grammar -::	1
"me013"::	I see.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	a  grammar,  basically,::	0
"me013"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	that um, wo- would be::	0
"fe008"::	a - a  possibility.  So y- so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky's model, an-::	0
"fe008"::	and do some top-down stuff, it - to help th- the bottom-up and merge the things or whatever,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	uh, it seems like::	0
"fe008"::	um, I don't see that there's an argument -::	0
"fe008"::	I'm - I - what I think is that why not have the corpus, since it's so expensive to put together, uh, useful for the widest::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	range of -::	0
"fe008"::	of central corp-::	0
"fe008"::	things that people generally  use  corpora for and which are, you know, used in computational linguistics.::	1
"fe008"::	That's - that's my point.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Which - which includes both top-down and bottom-up.::	0
"mn005"::	It's difficult.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K, well, i- i- let's - let's see what we can get.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, it - it - I think that if we're aiming at - at uh, groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together,::	1
"fe008"::	Yes, that's fine.::	0
"me013"::	and it's from the Berkeley campus, probably most of it::	0
"fe008"::	That's fine.::	0
"fe008"::	Exactly. And my point in m- in my note to Liz was::	1
"me013"::	will be O_K, but -::	1
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	I think that undergrads are an iff- iffy population.::	1
"fe016"::	I definitely agree with that, I mean, for this purpose.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Well, not to mention the fact that I would be::	0
"fe008"::	Grads and professors, fine.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen, probably even an- anyone under twenty-one.::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, you age-ist!::	0
"me011"::	What's that?::	0
"fe008"::	Age-ist.::	0
"me011"::	Well, age-ist.  The " eighteen " is because of the consent form.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.  "Age-ist".::	0
"fe016"::	Right,::	0
"me011"::	We'd hafta get - find their parent to sign for them.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's true.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	I have a - uh, um, question.  Well, Morgan, you were mentioning that Mari may not::	1
"fe016"::	use the k- equipment from I_B_M::	0
"fe016"::	if they found something else, cuz::	0
"me013"::	They're - they're - yeah, they're d- they're uh -::	0
"me013"::	assessing whether they should do that or y- do something else,::	0
"fe016"::	there's a -::	1
"me013"::	hopefully over the next few weeks.::	0
"fe016"::	Cuz I mean, one remote possibility is that::	1
"fe016"::	if we st- if we inherited that equipment, if she weren't using it, could we set up a room in the linguistics department?::	1
"fe016"::	And - and::	1
"fe016"::	I mean, there - there may be a lot more - or - or in psych, or in comp- wherever, in another building::	0
"fe016"::	where we could::	0
"fe016"::	um, record people there. I think we'd have a better chance of -::	1
"me011"::	I think we'd need a real motivated::	0
"me011"::	partner to do that. We'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.::	0
"fe016"::	Right, but -::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	But if there were such a - I mean it's a remote possibility, then::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	um, you know, one of  us  could you know, go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here. So it's just a::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	Well, the other thing -::	1
"fe016"::	just a thought if they end up not using the - the hardware.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, I mean the other thing that I was  hoping  to do in the  first  place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around. Uh.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	But.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	and -::	0
"me011"::	Well, I know that space is really scarce on - at least in C_S.::	0
"me013"::	Uh -::	0
"me011"::	You know, to - to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	But you may not need a  separate  room, you know, the idea is, if they have a  meeting  room::	0
"me011"::	That's true. True.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	and::	0
"fe016"::	they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth, and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something -::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	Well, maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something. You know.::	0
"fe016"::	Huh.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	I - I think it's not out of the question. Um.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	another::	0
"me011"::	type  of meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	But I - I - I think you need, uh, another portable  thing::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	a- another portable equipment to - to do, eh, more e- easier the recording process, eh,  out  from ICSI.::	0
"me011"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Eh  and   probably.  I don't know. Eh, if you - you want to - to record, eh, a seminar or a class, eh, in the university, you - you need -::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	1
"mn005"::	It- it would be eh eh very difficult to - to put,::	0
"mn005"::	eh, a lot of, eh, head phones eh in different people when::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, but -::	0
"mn005"::	you have to - to record only with, eh, this kind of, eh, d- device.::	0
"me011"::	I think if we - if we wanna just record with::	0
"me011"::	the tabletop microphones, that's easy.::	0
"mn005"::	Oh- yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Ye- Yeah, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right? That's  very  easy, but that's not the corpus that we're collecting.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Actually, that's a int- that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating.::	0
"me013"::	We realized that, um, when we were talking about this that, O_K, there's these different things that we want to do with it.::	0
"me013"::	So, um, it's true that we wanna be selective in some ways, uh, the way that you were speaking about with, uh, not having an interlingua and uh, these other issues.::	0
"me013"::	But on the other hand, it's not necessarily true that we need  all  of the corpus to satisfy  all  of it.::	0
"me013"::	So, a- a- as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that's done with a small n- recorded with a small, uh, typ- number of types of meetings::	0
"me013"::	But we can also have another part that's, uh, just one or two meetings of each of a - of a range of them and that's O_K too.::	0
"me013"::	Uh,::	1
"me013"::	i-::	0
"me013"::	We realized in discussion that the other thing is,::	0
"me013"::	what about this business of distant and close microphones?::	1
"me013"::	I mean, we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way, that's why we  did  it.::	1
"me013"::	But  what about -::	1
"me013"::	For th- for these issues of summarization, a lot of these higher level things  you  don't  really   need  the distant microphone.::	1
"fe016"::	Right, I mean, I c- I think there's -::	0
"me013"::	You  actually   don't.::	0
"me011"::	And you don't really need the  close  microphone, you mean.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yea- yeah yeah, you actually don't really even need  any  fancy microphone.  You can use found data.::	0
"fe008"::	Which one did you mean?::	0
"me013"::	You d-::	0
"me013"::	You don't ne- it doesn't - you just need  some  microphone,  somewhere.::	0
"me011"::	Ye- Yeah. Yep.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Tape recorder.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	You need  some  microphone, but I mean -::	0
"fe016"::	@@  You - you  can.  You can use -::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Um,::	0
"fe016"::	but I think that any  data that we spend a lot of effort  to collect,::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	you know, each person who's interested in - I mean, we have a cou- we have a bunch of different, um, slants and perspectives on what it's useful for,::	0
"fe016"::	um, they need to be::	0
"fe016"::	taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.::	1
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	And -::	1
"fe016"::	So in my case, um,::	0
"fe016"::	I think there w-::	0
"fe016"::	there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.::	1
"me011"::	Not enough for others, right.::	0
"fe016"::	And so  I'm looking and thinking, "Well I'd be  glad  to::	0
"fe016"::	walk over and record people and so  forth if it's -::	0
"fe016"::	to help th- in my interest."::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	And other people need to do that for themselves, uh, h-::	1
"me013"::	Right. So that -::	0
"fe016"::	or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal -::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But I think that - I'm raising that cuz I think it's relevant  exactly  for this idea up there that if you think about, "Well, gee, we have this really complicated setup to do," well maybe you  don't.::	0
"me013"::	Maybe if - if - If really all you want is to have a - a - a recording that's good enough to get a -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah. For some of it.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	uh, a transcription from later,::	0
"me013"::	you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, we - we could have a fairly - We could just get a DAT machine and -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, I agree with  Jane, though, on the other hand that -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So that might be true, you may say for instance, summarization, or something that::	0
"fe016"::	sounds very language oriented. You may say well,::	0
"fe016"::	"Oh yeah, you just do that from transcripts of a radio show." I mean, you don't even need the speech signal.    But::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	what you - what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is::	0
"fe016"::	to be able to pick up on::	0
"fe016"::	um -::	0
"fe016"::	Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to::	0
"fe016"::	be able to  determine  this. There's lots of cues you're not gonna have.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	So::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	I   do  think that long term you should always try to::	0
"fe016"::	satisfy the greatest number of -::	0
"fe016"::	of interests and have this parallel information, which is really what makes this::	0
"fe016"::	corpus powerful.::	1
"me011"::	Special?::	0
"me013"::	I - I -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	Otherwise, you know, lots of other sites can propose -::	0
"me013"::	I - I - I agree. Uh::	1
"fe016"::	individual studies, so -::	0
"me013"::	but I - I think that::	0
"me013"::	the uh  i-::	0
"me013"::	We can't really underestimate the difficulty -::	0
"me013"::	shouldn't  really u- underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.::	1
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	And so, - uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say, "Oh, we'll just  do  it up there," -::	1
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	If you're talking about something  simple,  where you throw away a lot of these dimensions, then you can do that right away.::	1
"me013"::	Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here,::	0
"me013"::	it  won't  happen quickly, it won't be easy, and there's all sorts of issues about th- you know::	0
"me013"::	keeping the equipment safe, or else hauling it around, and all sorts of o-::	0
"fe016"::	So::	0
"fe016"::	then maybe we should::	0
"fe016"::	try to bring people  here.::	0
"me013"::	I think the  first  priority should be to pry  to get - try to get people to come here.::	1
"me011"::	Here.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, that's that's -::	0
"fe016"::	O_K,  so that's::	0
"me013"::	We're set up for it.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	The room is - is really, uh, underused.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Uh -::	0
"fe008"::	I thought the free lunch idea was a  great  idea.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I thought so too.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, I - And I think we can get people to come here, that -::	1
"me013"::	Free lunch is good.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of::	1
"fe016"::	your time  and the overhead in bringing people down.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	No  crunchy  food.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, it would be  lunch afterwards. Right.::	0
"me011"::	Well, I was thinking, lunch after.::	0
"fe016"::	And they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, they have to do their digits or they don't  get - they don't  get their food.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah::	0
"me011"::	Um, I had a - I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered.::	1
"me011"::	Should I pursue that?::	1
"fe016"::	Oh, definitely, yeah.::	1
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So. They - they originally -::	0
"me011"::	They've decided not to do - go into speech.::	0
"me011"::	So I'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer, but I'll send an email and ask. I'll tell them about the free lunch. And they'll say there's no such thing.::	0
"me013"::	Tell them about the free lunch.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	I'd  love  to get people that are not linguists or engineers,::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	cuz these are both weird -::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	The - the -::	0
"fe016"::	well, I know, I shouldn't  say  that.::	1
"me013"::	The oth- the other h-::	0
"me011"::	That's alright. No, the- they - they're  very  weird.::	0
"fe016"::	We need a wider sampling.::	0
"me018"::	"Beep."::	0
"me013"::	Uh,  "beep"::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, the - the -::	0
"me011"::	The problem with engineers is "beep."::	0
"me013"::	They make funny sounds.::	1
"me013"::	The o- the o- the other -::	0
"me013"::	The other thing is,::	0
"me013"::	uh, that we - we talked about is give to them - uh, burn an extra C_D-ROM.::	1
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	and give them - So if they want a -  basically and audio record of their -::	0
"me011"::	Let them have their meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	Well,  I  thought that was -::	0
"fe016"::	I thought he meant, "Give them a music C_D," like they g-::	0
"me013"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	Then he said a C_D of the - of their speech and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to, but -::	0
"fe016"::	You know, I personally  would not want a  C_D  of my meeting, but::	0
"me011"::	Mmm.::	0
"me011"::	Of the meeting?::	0
"fe016"::	maybe - yeah,  maybe you're right.::	0
"me013"::	If you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like -::	0
"me018"::	Oh, that's a good idea.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	It'd be fun.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I think it would just be fun, you know, if nothing else, you know.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But it als-::	0
"me011"::	It's a novelty item.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	It - it - it also I think builds up towards the  goal.  We're saying, "Look, you know, you're gonna get this. Is- is- isn't that neat. Then you're gonna go home with it. It's actually p-::	0
"me013"::	It's probably gonna be pretty useless to you,::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	but you'll ge- appreciate, you know, where it's useful and where it's useless,::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	and then, we're gonna move this technology, so it'll become  useful. "::	0
"me013"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	No, I think that's a great idea, actually. But we might need a little more to incentivize them,  that's all.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	What if you could tell them that you'll give them the - the transcripts when they come back?::	0
"fe008"::	Alth-::	0
"me011"::	Oh, yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Oh yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I mean,  anyone  can have the  transcripts.  So.::	0
"fe016"::	Well,  that's  interesting.::	0
"fe008"::	I hav- I have to uh raise a little eensy-weensy concern about doing th- giving them the C_D immediately,::	0
"me011"::	I thought we could point that out.::	0
"fe008"::	because of these issues of, you know,  this  kind of stuff,::	0
"fe008"::	where maybe -::	0
"fe008"::	You know?::	0
"me013"::	Good point.::	0
"fe008"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	That's a very good point. So we can - so we can -::	0
"fe008"::	We could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.::	1
"me013"::	r- Right.::	0
"fe008"::	And then they - they get a C_D, but just not the same day.::	0
"fe016"::	Oh, right.::	0
"fe016"::	If - It should be the same C_D-ROM that we distribute publically, right?::	1
"me011"::	Yeah, that's right.::	0
"me011"::	That's a good point.::	0
"me011"::	Right, it can't be the internal one.::	0
"fe016"::	Otherwise they're not  allowed  to::	0
"me013"::	Although it's -::	0
"fe008"::	There  we go. Oh, I  like  that.::	0
"me011"::	That's right.::	0
"fe016"::	play  it for anyone.::	0
"fe008"::	Well put. Well put.::	0
"fe008"::	So, after the transcript screening phase.::	1
"me011"::	Yeah, that's true.::	0
"fe008"::	Things have been weeded out.::	0
"fe016"::	Otherwise we'd need  two  lawyer stages.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's right, say::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	"Yeah, well, I got this C_D, and, Your Honor, I -"::	0
"fe016"::	That's a good point.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah so that's - so let's start with Haas, and::	0
"fe016"::	Sorry to have to -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Sorry I have to  leave.::	1
"fe016"::	I will be here full-time next week.::	1
"me013"::	Oh, that's fine.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, see you.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	No.::	0
"me011"::	Bye.::	0
"me013"::	That's alright.::	0
"me018"::	See you.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn005"::	See you.::	0
"me013"::	So, uh -::	0
"me013"::	Let's see. So that was that topic,::	0
"me013"::	and::	1
"me013"::	then um, I guess another topic would be::	0
"me013"::	where are we in the whole disk resources  question for -::	1
"me011"::	We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp- room to record meetings.::	0
"me011"::	So I uh did a bunch of archiving, and::	0
"me011"::	still doing a bunch of archiving, I - I'm in the midst of doing::	0
"me011"::	the P_files from uh,::	0
"me011"::	Broadcast News.::	0
"me011"::	and it took eleven hours::	0
"mn005"::	Eleven?::	0
"me011"::	to do - to uh copy it.::	0
"me011"::	And it'll take  another  eleven to do the clone.::	0
"me018"::	Where did you copy it to?::	0
"me011"::	Well, it's  Abbott.::	0
"me011"::	It's Abbott, so it just -::	0
"me011"::	But it's - it's a lot of data.::	0
"me013"::	Sk-::	0
"me013"::	It's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott?::	0
"me011"::	Tape.::	0
"mn005"::	Tape?::	0
"me011"::	I did an archive.::	0
"me013"::	Oh! I'm sorry.::	0
"me018"::	Oh, on the tape. Ah!::	0
"mn005"::	Oh.::	0
"me011"::	So I'm archiving it, and then I'm gonna delete the files.::	0
"me011"::	So that will give us::	0
"mn005"::	Eleven hours?::	0
"me018"::	Wow!::	0
"me011"::	ten gigabytes of free space.::	0
"mn005"::	Oh.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, the archiving m-  program does take a long time.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And - and -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me011"::	And so one-::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	That - that will be done, like,::	0
"me011"::	in about two hours. And so uh,::	0
"me011"::	at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings. So.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	One thing - The  good  news about that - that is that once - once it's archived, it's pretty quick to get back. I mean, it - it - it - The other direction is fast,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Is it?::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	but this direction is really slow.::	0
"me013"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Well, especially because I'm generating a clone, also.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, O_K.::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And that takes a while.::	0
"me018"::	Generating a clone?::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's a good point.::	0
"me011"::	Two copies.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	One offsite, one onsite.::	0
"me018"::	Oh!::	0
"me018"::	Oh!::	0
"me018"::	Hunh!::	0
"fe008"::	Now, what will uh - Is the plan to g-  to -::	0
"me013"::	S-::	0
"fe008"::	So::	0
"fe008"::	stuff will be  saved,  it's just that you're relocating it?::	0

"me011"::	By " we " of course I mean  Dave.  So.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	Hmm. I've been looking at the, uh,::	0
"me018"::	Aurora data::	0
"me018"::	and, um,::	0
"me018"::	first - first look at it,::	0
"me018"::	there were basically three::	0
"me018"::	directories on there that could be moved.::	0
"me018"::	One was called Aurora, one was Spanish, which was Carmen's Spanish stuff, and the other one was, um,::	0
"me011"::	SPINE.::	0
"me018"::	SPINE.::	0
"me018"::	And so, um,::	0
"me018"::	I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that::	0
"me018"::	the SPINE stuff was moving to a non-backed-up disk.::	0
"me018"::	So, um,::	0
"me018"::	I realized that::	0
"me018"::	well, probably not all of that should be moved, just::	0
"me018"::	the::	0
"me018"::	C_D-ROM type data, the -::	0
"me018"::	the static data.::	0
"me018"::	So I moved that,::	0
"me018"::	and then um,::	0
"me018"::	I asked him to check out and see if it was O_K.::	0
"me018"::	before I actually deleted the old stuff,::	0
"me018"::	um, but I haven't heard back  yet .::	0
"me018"::	I told him he could delete it if he wanted to, I haven't checked::	0
"me018"::	today to see if he's deleted it or not.::	0
"me018"::	And then Carmen's stuff, I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to X_A,::	0
"me018"::	I had copied stuff there that was::	0
"me018"::	dynamic data.::	0
"me018"::	And so,::	0
"me018"::	I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data.::	0
"me018"::	And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk.::	0
"me018"::	And then I lo- haven't done any of the Aurora stuff. I have to meet with, uh, Stephane::	0
"me018"::	to do that. So.::	0
"me013"::	So, but, uh y-::	0
"me013"::	you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the Broadcast News,::	0
"me013"::	but, we have some::	0
"me013"::	other  disks, some of which you're using for Aurora, but::	0
"me013"::	are we g- do we have some other -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	other space now?::	0
"me011"::	So, so,::	0
"me011"::	uh, we have space on the current disk right now, where Meeting Recorder is,::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	and that's probably enough for about four meetings.::	0
"me018"::	Is that the one that has - is that D_C?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me011"::	No, no,  well, it's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is. I think it's D_I.::	0
"me018"::	O_K, I - but the stuff I'm moving from Aurora is on the D_C disk that we -::	0
"me011"::	I don't remember.::	0
"me011"::	Th- I think it's D_C- It's whatever that one is.::	0
"me018"::	O_K, D_C. Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I just don't remember, it might be D_C.::	0
"me011"::	And::	0
"me011"::	that has enough for about four  more   meetings right now.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty-six for reasons I don't understand.::	0
"me011"::	Um, someone deleted something somewhere.::	0
"me011"::	And so we have some room again.::	0
"me011"::	And then::	0
"me011"::	with Broadcast News, that's five or six more meetings, so, you know, we have a couple weeks.::	0
"me011"::	Uh, so, yeah, I think - I think we're O_K, until we get the new disk.::	0
"mn005"::	O_K .::	0
"me018"::	So should, um -::	0
"me018"::	One question I had for you was,::	0
"me018"::	um,::	0
"me018"::	we need -::	0
"me018"::	we sh- probably should move the Aurora an-::	0
"me018"::	and all that other stuff off of::	0
"me018"::	the Meeting Recorder disk.::	0
"me018"::	Is there another backed-up  disk that you know of that would - ?::	0
"me011"::	We should put it onto the Broadcast News one.::	0
"me011"::	That's probably the best thing to do. And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk  rather than spreading them out.::	0
"me018"::	O_K.::	0
"me018"::	Right.::	0
"me018"::	Right. Do you know what - happen to know what disk that is off - ? O_K.::	0

"me018"::	Alright, I'll find out from you.::	0

"me013"::	See what I'd - I'd - Let me tell you what  I  would do.::	0
"me013"::	I would take::	1
"me013"::	just a  few  features. Instead of taking all the M_F_C_C's, or all the P_L_P's or whatever,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	I would just take a  couple.::	1
"me013"::	O_K? Like - like C_one, C_two, something like that, so that you can  visualize  it.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	and look at these different examples and look at  scatter  plots.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K, so before you do - build up any kind of fancy classifiers,::	1
"me013"::	just take a look in two dimensions, at how these things are split apart.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is  likely  to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And the second thing is, once you actually  get  to the point of building these classifiers,::	0
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	what  this  lacks so far is the  temporal  properties.::	0
"me013"::	So if you're just looking at a frame and a time, you don't know anything about, you know, the structure of it over  time,  and so::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	you may wanna build  @@  - build a Markov model of some sort::	0

"me013"::	Uh, I think to know what it's - to have a better feeling for what it's doing, you wanna  look  at it.::	0

"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	And, uh, in L_P_C, uh, the thing to particularly look at is, I think - is something::	1

"mn005"::	You- I don't- u-::	0
"me013"::	O_K, but, I - I think - in  any  event we're agreed that the first step is -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	i-::	0
"me013"::	Because what we had before for - for uh, speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So the first thing is for you to - to build up something that will detect the overlaps.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right? So again, I think::	0
"me013"::	the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh, in - in - in -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Features?::	0
"me013"::	in - Well, I -::	0
"me013"::	again, the things you've written up there I think are way too - way too big.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K? If you're talking about, say, twelfth - twelfth-order uh M_F_C_C's or something like that it's just way too much. You won't be able to  look  at it.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	All you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Whereas I think if you have things - if you pick one or two dimensional::	0
"me013"::	things, or three of you have some very fancy display,::	0
"me013"::	uh, and look at how the - the different classes separate themselves out, you'll have much more insight about what's going on.::	0
"mn005"::	It will be enough.::	0
"me013"::	Well, you'll - you'll get a  feeling  for what's happening, you know, so if you look at -::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Suppose you look at first- and second-order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things::	0
"me013"::	and you find that the first-order is much more effective than the second,::	0
"me013"::	and then you look at the third and there's not - and not too much there,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	you may just take::	0
"me013"::	first- and second-order cepstral coefficients, right? And with L_P_C, I think L_P_C per se isn't gonna tell you much more than - than - than the other, maybe.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, and uh on the other hand, the L_P_C residual, the energy in the L_P_C residual,::	1
"me013"::	will say how well, uh::	0
"me013"::	the low-order L_P_C::	0
"me013"::	model's fitting it, which should be::	0
"me013"::	pretty poorly for two- two or more::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	people speaking at the same time, and it should be pretty well, for w- for - for one.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And so  I - i- again, if you take a few of these things that are - are::	0
"me013"::	prob- um    promising  features and look at them in pairs,::	0
"me013"::	uh, I think you'll have much more of a sense of "O_K, I now have -::	0
"me013"::	uh, doing a bunch of these analyses, I now have ten likely candidates."::	1
"me013"::	And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.::	1

"mn005"::	Eh, why? Because eh the spectral distortion is -::	0

"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	P_D_A speech file is eh - it will be eh difficult. I -::	0

"fe008"::	The - the P_D_A is messier.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, fff!::	0
"mn005"::	Because the n- the noise eh to sp- the signal-to-noise relation is eh - is - is low.::	0

"mn005"::	signal to - to - to noise relation, you know, eh with -::	0
"me013"::	Well, I think - I think - I think it's not a - it's not at all unreasonable. It makes sense to start with the simpler signal::	0
"me013"::	because if you have features which don't - aren't even::	0
"me013"::	helpful::	0
"me013"::	in the  high  signal-to-noise ratio, then there's no point in putting them into the  low  signal ratio, one would  think,  anyway.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And so, if you can get -::	1
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	Uh again, my prescription would be::	0
"me013"::	that you would, with a mixed::	0
"me013"::	signal, you would take a collection of possible uh, features::	0
"me013"::	look  at them,::	0
"me013"::	look at how these different classes that you've marked, separate themselves,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	and then collect, uh in pairs,::	0
"me013"::	and then collect ten of them or something, and then proceed::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	with a bigger classifier.::	1
"me013"::	And then if you can get that to work well,::	1
"me013"::	then you go to the other signal.::	1
"me013"::	And then, and you and you know, they won't work as well, but::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	how m- you know, how much -::	0

"me013"::	So th- the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a  pathological  error. If someone just  happens  to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.::	0
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0

"me013"::	Uh, if they're - if they're  close,  it's just a question of the sensitivity.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So if the sensitivity is good enough - and we just - we just don't have enough, uh, experience with it to know how -::	0

"fe008"::	Yeah. Oh I'm not - I'm not trying to argue against using it, by any means. I just wanted to point out that -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	that weakness, that it's topo- topologically impossible::	0

"fe008"::	Great. No, I don't mean to discourage that at all.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, the other thing you can do - uh, if - I mean, i- We're  assuming  that it would be a big deal just to get somebody - convince somebody to put two microphones in the P_D_A.::	0
"me013"::	But if you h- put a  third  in,::	1
"me013"::	you could put in the other axis. And then you know - then you're sort of -::	0
"me018"::	Once you got  two  -::	0
"fe008"::	Interesting.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, then - then you pretty much could cover -::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Interesting.::	0
"me018"::	Well what about just doing it from  these  mikes?::	0
"me018"::	You know?::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn005"::	It will be more interesting to study the P_Z_M because the - the - the separation - I - I think -::	0

"me013"::	can we do with what we  think  would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a P_D_A.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	That's what I was asking about, what are the constraints?::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0

"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0

"me018"::	a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall. It has all these mikes and it has a plug-in jack to the P_D_A.::	0
"fe008"::	Interesting.::	0
"me013"::	The  other  thing actually, that gets at this a little bit of something  else  I'd like to do, is what happens if you have two  P_D_As   and they  communicate  with each other?::	1

"fe008"::	It's just - Yeah. O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	I - I'll give you the short version, but I do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes.::	0

"fe008"::	O_K, so -::	0
"fe008"::	the - the short thing is::	0
"fe008"::	um, we have::	0
"fe008"::	uh, tape recording- uh, uh, sorry, digitized recor- recordings.::	0
"fe008"::	Those we won't be able to change. If someone says "Hey, Roger so-and-so".::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	So that's gonna stay that person's name.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe008"::	Now, in terms of like the  transcript,::	0
"fe008"::	the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody's name,::	1
"fe008"::	and whether you're gonna put it  in  the text where he says "Hey Roger" or are we gonna put that person's anonymized name in instead?::	1
"me011"::	No, because  then    that  would give you a  mapping,::	0
"me011"::	and you don't  wanna  have a mapping.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, so first decision is, we're gonna anonymize the same name::	0
"fe008"::	for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.::	0
"me011"::	No.::	1
"me018"::	I don't -::	0
"me011"::	Because that would give you a  mapping  between the speaker's  real  name and the  tag  we're using,::	0
"fe008"::	I - I don't think you understood what I - what I said. So -::	0
"me011"::	and we don't want -::	1
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	uh, so in - within the context of an utterance, someone says "So, Roger, what do  you  think?"::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Then, uh, it seems to me that -::	1
"fe008"::	Well, maybe I - uh it seems to me that if you change the name,::	0
"fe008"::	the transcript's gonna disagree with the audio, and you won't be able to use that.::	1
"me011"::	We don't - we wanna - we ha- we want the transcript to be " Roger ".::	0
"me018"::	Right, you don't wanna do that.::	0
"me011"::	Because if we made the - the  transcript  be the  tag  that we're using for Roger,::	1
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	someone who had the  transcript  and the  audio  would then have a  mapping::	0
"me011"::	between the  anonymized  name and the  real  name, and we wanna  avoid  that.::	1
"fe008"::	O_K, well, but then::	1
"fe008"::	there's this issue of if we're gonna use this for a  discourse  type of thing,::	0
"fe008"::	then -::	0
"fe008"::	and, you know, Liz was mentioning stuff in  a  previous meeting about gaze direction and who's - who's the  addressee  and all,::	0
"me011"::	Oh.::	0
"fe008"::	then to have "Roger" be the thing in the  utterance  and then actually have the  speaker  identifier who  was  "Roger" be " Frank ",::	0
"fe008"::	that's going to be  really   confusing  and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.::	1
"me011"::	Ugh!    That's a good point.::	0
"fe008"::	Now, if you want to, you know, I mean, in some cases, I - I - I know that Susan Ervin-Tripp in some of hers, uh, actually did do uh, um, a filter of the s- signal where the person's name was mentioned, except::	0
"me013"::	Yeah::	0
"fe008"::	And - and I - cer- and I - So, I mean, the question then becomes one level  back.::	0
"fe008"::	Um, how important  is  it for a person to be identified by first name versus  full  name?::	1
"fe008"::	Well,::	0
"fe008"::	on the one hand,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, it's not a full identity, we're taking all these precautions,::	0
"fe008"::	um::	0
"fe008"::	and  they'll  be taking precautions, which are probably even the more  important  ones, to - they'll be reviewing the transcripts, to see if there's something they don't like -  O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	So, maybe, uh, maybe that's enough protection. On the other hand,::	1
"fe008"::	this is a small - this is a small pool, and people who say things about topic X_::	0
"fe008"::	e- who are researchers and well-known in the field, they'll be identifiable and simply from the - from the first name.::	1
"fe008"::	However, taking one step  further  back, they'd be identifiable  anyway,  even if we  changed  all the names.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe008"::	So, is it really, um -::	0
"me011"::	Ugh!::	0
"fe008"::	You know?::	0
"fe008"::	Now, in terms of like - so I - I did some results, which I'll report on n- next time,::	0
"fe008"::	which  do  mention individual speakers by  name.::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Now,  there,  the Human Subjects Committee is very precise.::	0
"fe008"::	You don't wanna mention subjects by name::	0
"fe008"::	in published reports.::	1
"fe008"::	Now, it would be very  possible  for me to take those data::	0
"fe008"::	put them in a - in a study, and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, once you get to the publication you can certainly do that. You can go, you know, uh, "Z_"  uh, for instance. Uh.::	0
"fe008"::	And someone who looked -::	1

"me013"::	Um, yeah, I mean, t- it doesn't -::	0
"me013"::	I mean, I'm not knowledgeable about this, but it certainly doesn't bother  me  to have someone's first name in - in the - in the transcript.::	0

"me011"::	O_K.  @@::	0

"fe008"::	you know, I was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names,::	0
"fe008"::	and - and it was - and we made the decision that was kind of artificial. Well, I mean, if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the  transcript,  we've basically done something one step  worse.::	0

"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Well, I would sug- I - I -  don't  wanna change the names in the transcript, but that's because I'm focused so much on the  acoustics  instead of on the  discourse,  and so I think that's a  really  good  point.::	1
"fe008"::	Misleading.::	0

"me013"::	I mean, I'm just always asking Jose what he's doing, you know, and -  and so it's -  There's uh, there's obviously other things going on.::	0
"fe008"::	I just - I just couldn't do it in two minutes.::	0
"me011"::	How will we - how would the person who's doing the  transcript::	1
"me011"::	even  know  who they're  talking  about?::	1
"me011"::	Do you know what I'm saying?::	0
"me018"::	"The person who's doing the transcript -"  The  I_B_M  people?::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I mean, so- so - how is that information gonna get labeled  anyway?::	1
"fe008"::	How do you mean, who - what they're - who they're talking about?::	0
"fe008"::	How do you mean?::	0
"me011"::	I mean, so if I'm saying in a meeting, "oh and  Bob,  by the way, wanted - wanted to do  so-and-so ",::	0
"me018"::	They're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do  @@  -::	0
"me011"::	if you're doing -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah,  @@  they're just gonna write "Bob".::	0
"me011"::	And so.::	0
"fe008"::	They won't be able to change it  themselves.::	0
"me011"::	If you're - if you're doing  discourse  analysis,  a-::	0
"me013"::	What ar- how are they gonna do  any  of this?::	0
"fe008"::	Well, I - I'm betting we're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un-::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, really.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, they're gonna say speaker-one, or speaker-two or speaker- I mean I - I -::	0
"fe008"::	untranscribable by  them.::	0
"me011"::	Well, the  current  one they don't do  speaker  identity.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah, I think -::	0
"me018"::	They can't do that.::	0
"me011"::	because in NaturallySpeaking, or,  excuse  me, in  ViaVoice,  it's only one  person.::	1
"me011"::	and so in their  current  conventions there  are  no multiple speaker  conventions.::	1
"me013"::	So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh.  I think that - My understanding from Yen-::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe008"::	Is it Yen-Ching? Is that how you pronounce her name? Oh, uh  Yu-Ching?  Yu-Ching?::	0
"me013"::	Uh  Yu-Ching, Yu-Ching. Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	y- Yu-Ching.::	0
"fe008"::	was that um, they will - that they will adopt the - part of the conventions that - that we discussed,::	0
"fe008"::	where they put speaker identifier down.::	0
"fe008"::	But, you know, h- they won't know these people, so I think::	0
"fe008"::	it's - Well, they'll - they'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified::	0
"fe008"::	to them - So they'll do something::	0
"fe008"::	like speaker-one, speaker-two, is what  I  bet, but I'm betting there'll be huge variations in the accuracy of - of their labeling the speakers. We'll have to review the transcripts in any case.::	0
"me013"::	And it - and it may very  well  be - I mean, since::	0
"me013"::	they're not going to sit there and - and - and worry ab- about, uh, it being the same speaker,::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	they may very  well  go the - eh the - the first se- the first time it changes to another speaker, that'll be speaker- two.  And the next time it'll be speaker- three  even if it's actually speaker- one.::	0
"fe008"::	You know - Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	You know, that would be a very practical solution on their part.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah. It's a good idea.::	0
"fe008"::	And - and - but then we would need to label it. And that's O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.  Yeah, I think -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah we - we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close-talking mikes.::	0
"fe008"::	Yes, I was thinking, the temp- the time values of when it changes.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So. But I mean that doesn't -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But that -::	0
"fe008"::	That'd be very efficient.::	0
"me011"::	This doesn't answer the - the  question.::	0
"me011"::	The p-::	0
"me011"::	It's a good point, "which - what do you do for discourse tracking?"::	0
"mn005"::	Because y- y- you don't know to know, eh -::	0
"me011"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	you don't need to know what i- what is the iden- identification of the - of the speakers. You only::	0
"mn005"::	eh want to know -::	0
"me011"::	For - for  acoustics  you don't but for  discourse  you do.::	0
"me013"::	Well, you  do.::	0
"mn005"::	Ah, for discourse, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. If - if - if - if someone says, uh, "what - what is Jose  doing? " and then Jose  says  something, you need to know that that was Jose  responding.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, so.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah,::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	@@  Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Ugh,    that's a problem.::	0
"fe008"::	Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id- to make a point of  not  identifying people by name, which then leads you to be more contextually ex- explicit.::	0
"me018"::	That  would be hard.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, people are very flexible. You know? I mean, so when we did this las- last week, I felt that you know, now, Andreas may, uh,::	0
"fe008"::	@@::	0
"fe008"::	uh, he - he -::	0
"fe008"::	i- sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they  miss  a sentence or something, and -::	0
"fe008"::	and because he  missed  something, then he missed the r- the initial introduction of who we were  talking  about, and was - was unable to do the  tracking.  But I felt like  most  of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the  name.  So, people are really flexible.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	But, you know, like, at the beginning of  this  meeting -::	0
"me018"::	Or,  you  I think said,  you know, or s-  Liz,  said something about um, uh, "is  Mari  gonna use the  equipment? "::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah?::	0
"me018"::	I mean,  how  would you  say  that?::	0
"me018"::	I mean, you  have  to really  think,::	0
"me011"::	if you wanted to  anonymize.::	0
"me018"::	you know, about what you're  saying  bef-::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	"Is you know who up in you know where?" Right? Use the -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	1
"me018"::	I think it would be really  hard  if we made a policy where we didn't say  names,::	0
"me011"::	Yeah,  darn!  I mean, what I was gonna  say  is that the other  option  is that we could bleep  out  the  names.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, is -::	0
"fe008"::	Well, it-::	0
"me018"::	plus we'd have to  tell  everybody  else.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	but then, again that kills your  discourse  analysis.  Ugh!::	0
"me018"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	That's -  that's  the issue.::	0
"me018"::	I - I think the - I think -::	0
"me018"::	I don't know, my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in::	0
"me018"::	the recordings,::	0
"me018"::	you only anonymize::	0
"me018"::	to the extent you  can,::	0
"me011"::	Well, but that- but that - as I said, that - that - that works great for the  acoustics,  but it - it hurts you a lot for trying to do  discourse.::	0
"me018"::	the speakers have signed the forms and all.::	0
"fe008"::	Well.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Th-::	0
"me018"::	Why?::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Because you don't have a map of who's  talking  versus  their  name that they're being  referred  to.::	0
"me013"::	Bec-::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	I thought we were gonna get it labeled speaker-one, speaker-two -::	0
"me011"::	Sure but, h- then you have to  know  that Jose is speaker-one and -::	0
"me018"::	Why do you have to know his name?::	0
"me013"::	O_K, so suppose someone says, "well I don't know if I really heard what -::	0
"me013"::	uh, what Jose said."::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And  then,  Jose responds.::	0
"me013"::	And part of your learning about the  dialogue  is Jose  responding  to it.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But it doesn't  say  "Jose", it says "speaker- five ".::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	So  uh  u-::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Oh, I see, you wanna associated the word "Jose" in the dialogue with::	0
"me018"::	the fact that then he responded.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Someone who's doing  discourse  would wanna  do  that.::	0
"me013"::	And so, if we pass out the data to someone else,::	0
"me013"::	and it says "speaker- five " there, we  also  have to pass them this little  guide  that says that speaker-five is  Jose,::	0
"me013"::	and if were gonna do that we might as well  give them "Jose" - say it was "Jose".::	0
"me011"::	And that  violates  our  privacy.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And that violates our  privacy   issue.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm. Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Now, I - I think that we have these two phases in the - in the data, which is the one which is o- our use, University of Washington's use, I_B_M, S_R_I.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	And within  that,::	0
"fe008"::	it  may  be that it's sufficient to not uh change the - to not incorporate anonymization yet,::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	but  always,  always in the publications we have to.::	1
"fe008"::	And I think also, when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world, we  have  to.::	0
"fe008"::	But I - but I don- that's - that's a long way from now and - and it's a matter of -::	0
"fe008"::	between now and then of d- of  deciding   how -::	0
"me011"::	Making some decisions?::	0
"fe008"::	i- i- it - You know, it may be s- that we- we'll need to do something like actually X_ out that part of the um - the audio, and just put in brackets "speaker-one".::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	For the  public  one.::	0
"mn005"::	the ??::	0
"me011"::	You know, what we could  do  also is have more than one version of  release.  One that's  public::	0
"fe008"::	You know.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	and one - one that requires licensing.::	0
"me011"::	And so the  licensed  one would - w- we could - it would be a  sticky  limitation.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	I think that's risky. I think that the public should be the same.::	0
"me011"::	You know, like - Well, we can talk about that later.::	0
"fe008"::	I think that when we do that world release, it should be the same.::	0
"me013"::	I - I agree.::	0
"fe008"::	For a bunch of reasons, legal.::	0
"me013"::	I - I agree with Jane. I - I think that we - we have a - need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort,::	1
"fe008"::	But I also think a  consistent    licensing   policy is important.::	0
"me013"::	and -::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Well, one thing to- to take into consideration is::	0
"me018"::	w- are there any::	0
"me018"::	um - For example, the people who are funding this work,::	0
"me018"::	they want this work to get out and be useful for  discourse.  If we all of a sudden  do  this and then release it to the  public  and it's not longer useful for  discourse,::	0
"me011"::	Well, depending on how much  editing  we do, you  might  be able to  still have it  useful.::	0
"me018"::	you know -::	0
"me011"::	because for  discourse  you don't need the  audio.::	0
"me011"::	Right? So you could  bleep   out  the names in the  audio.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	and use the anonymized one through the  transcript.::	0
"fe008"::	Excuse  me. We - we  do  need audio for discourse.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me018"::	But if you release  both  -::	0
"me011"::	But, n- excuse me, but you could bleep out just the names.::	0
"me013"::	She -::	0
"me013"::	No, but she's saying, from the argument  before,  she wants to be able to  say  if someone said "Jose" in their - in their thing, and then connect to so- to what he said later, then you  need  it.::	0
"me011"::	Right. But in the  transcript,  you could say, everywhere they said " Jose "::	0
"me011"::	that you could::	0
"me011"::	replace it with "speaker- seven ".::	0
"me013"::	Oh I see.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. But I -  I  also  wanna say that people -::	0
"me013"::	I  see.::	0
"me011"::	And then it wouldn't meet - match the  audio  anymore.  But it would be still useful for the -::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me018"::	But if both of those are publically available -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. That's good.::	0
"me011"::	But they -::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, you see? So, it's complicated.::	1
"me013"::	And th- and the  other  thing is if - if - if Liz were here,  what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue, and so,  uh,  yeah.::	1
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. I think we have to think about w-::	1
"me013"::	Sorry.::	0
"fe008"::	@@::	0
"fe008"::	how. I think that this can't be decided today.::	1
"me011"::	Yeah, O_K, good point.::	0
"fe008"::	But it's g- but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	I didn't think - when I wrote you that  email  I wasn't thinking it was a big can of  worms,  but I guess it  is.::	0
"fe008"::	do it next time.::	0
"mn005"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, a lot of these things are.::	0
"fe008"::	Well it - Discourse, you know -  Also  I wanted to make the point that - that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a  transcript.  It's gonna be looking at a t-::	0
"me011"::	Discourse.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, ab- absolutely.::	0
"me011"::	Oh, yeah, sure.::	0
"fe008"::	You know, and prosod- prosodic stuff is involved, and that means you're going to be listening to the audio, and then you come directly into this - confronting this problem.::	0
"me018"::	Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do  research  on discourse,::	0
"fe008"::	So.::	0
"me018"::	and then, we wouldn't have to worry about it.::	0
"mn005"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, we should just market it to non-English speaking countries.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own  name.::	0
"mn005"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Did you read the paper on Eurospeech?::	0
"fe008"::	We could have little labels. I - I - I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again, which is everyone has like "Mister White", "Mister Pink",  "Mister Blue".::	0
"me018"::	Mister White.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were  reversing  the  syllables?::	0
"me011"::	They were di- they- they  had  the  utterances.  and they would  extract  out the  syllables  and they would  play  them  backwards.::	0
"me018"::	But - so, the syllables were in the same order, with respect to each other, but the acous-::	0
"me011"::	Everything was in the  same   order, but they were - the individual syll-  syllables were played backwards.::	0
"me011"::	And you could  listen  to it,  and it would sound the  same.::	0
"me018"::	What did it  sound  like?::	0
"me011"::	People had  no  difficulty in- interpreting it.::	0
"me011"::	So what we  need  is something that's the  reverse,  that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't  understand  it.::	0
"me018"::	What?::	0
"me013"::	Oh, well that's - there's an  easy  way to do  that.::	0
"me013"::	Jus- jus- just  play  it all  backwards.::	0
"me011"::	Oh right. The speech recognizer's totally symmetric, isn't it.::	0
"me013"::	What, what does the  speech  recognizer care?::	0
"me011"::	Ah, anyway.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, do we do digits? Or - ?  What do we do?::	0
"me013"::	Let's do digits. Yeah, we - we - we already missed the party. So.::	0
"me011"::	Uh - O_K, we'll quickly do digits.::	0
"fe008"::	Or do we just quit?::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, go off here.::	0
"me018"::	like as if you were talking::	0
"me018"::	like, "nine eight six eight seven?"::	0
"fe008"::	Well, you know, in the - in the one I transcribed, I did find a couple instances -  I found one instance of contrastive stress, where it was like the string had a -::	0
"fe008"::	li- So it was like "nine eight two four, nine  nine  two four".::	0
"me018"::	Oh, really. So they were like looking ahead, huh?::	0
"fe008"::	And -::	0
"fe008"::	Well, they  differed.  I mean, at that -  that  session I did feel like they did it more as  sentences.::	0
"fe008"::	But, um, sometimes people do it as phone numbers.  I mean, I've - I::	0
"fe008"::	am sort of interested in - in - And sometimes, you know, I s-::	0
"me018"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe008"::	And I -  I  never know. When  I  do it, I -::	0
"fe008"::	I ask myself what I'm  doing  each time.  and I -::	0
"me018"::	Well, I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this::	0
"me018"::	They may as well throw in some interesting intonations.::	0
"me011"::	Well, except, yeah.  We have the transcript. We have the actual numbers they're reading, so we're not necessarily depending on that. O_K, I'm gonna go off.::	0
"fe008"::	I  like  your  question  intonation. That's  very  funny. I haven't heard  that  one.::	0
