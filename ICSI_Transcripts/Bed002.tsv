"me003"::	I guess.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, we're on.::	0
"me011"::	So just make sure that th- your wireless mike is on,::	0
"me011"::	if you're wearing a wireless.::	0
"me003"::	Check one. Check one.::	0
"me011"::	And you should be able to see which one - which one you're on by, uh, watching the little bars change.::	0
"mn015"::	So, which is  my  bar?  Mah!::	0
"mn015"::	Number one.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me003"::	Sibilance. Sibilance.::	0
"me011"::	So, actually, if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now, as long as you've signed the consent form, that's alright.::	0
"me003"::	Are we supposed to read digits at the same time?::	0
"me011"::	No.::	0
"me003"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"me011"::	No. Each individually. We're  talking  about doing all at the same time but I think  cognitively  that would be  really  difficult.::	0
"me011"::	To try to read them while everyone else is.::	0
"me003"::	Everyone would need  extreme  focus.::	0
"me011"::	So, when you're reading the digit strings, the first thing to do is just say which transcript you're on.::	0
"me010"::	Other way.::	0
"me010"::	We m-::	0
"me010"::	We may wind up with ver-::	0
"me010"::	We - we may need versions of all this garbage.::	0
"mn015"::	For  our  stuff. Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	So the first thing you'd wanna do is just say which transcript you're on. So.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	You can see the transcript? There's two large number strings on the digits?::	0
"me011"::	So you would just read that one.::	0
"me011"::	And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines.::	0
"me011"::	And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I'll give - I'll read the digit strings first, so can see how that goes.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	Again, I'm not sure how much I should talk about::	0
"me011"::	stuff before everyone's here.::	0
"me010"::	Mmm. Well, we have  one  more coming.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Well, why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. Well, we can start doing it.::	0
"me011"::	Thanks.::	0
"me011"::	So, uh, just also a note on wearing the microphones. All of you look like you're::	0
"me011"::	doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth,::	0
"me011"::	and then, at the corner.::	0
"me011"::	And that's so that you minimize breath sounds,::	0
"me011"::	so that when you're breathing, you don't breathe into the mike.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, that's good.::	0
"me011"::	And uh -::	0
"me011"::	So, everyone needs to fill out,::	0
"me011"::	only  once,  the speaker form and the consent form.::	0
"me011"::	And the short form -::	0
"me011"::	I mean, you should  read  the consent form, but::	0
"me011"::	uh, the thing to notice is that we  will  give you an opportunity::	0
"me011"::	to edit a- all the transcripts.::	0
"me011"::	So, if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public,::	0
"me011"::	which, these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them,::	0
"me011"::	uh,::	0
"me011"::	you'll be given an opportunity by email,::	0
"me011"::	uh, to bleep out any portions you don't like.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can.::	0
"me011"::	If you're not exactly sure about the region,::	0
"me011"::	we're not exactly sure either. So, don't worry too much about it.  The - It's just self rating.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	And I think that's about it.::	0
"me011"::	I mean , should I -::	0
"me011"::	Do you want me to talk at all about  why  we're doing this and what this project is? or - ?::	0
"me010"::	Um, yeah. No. There was - there was - Let's see.::	0
"me003"::	Does Nancy know that we're meeting in here?::	0
"me010"::	Oh -::	0
"me010"::	She got an emai- she was notified.::	0
"mn015"::	I sent an email.::	0
"me003"::	Oh yeah, she got an e- Yeah, yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Whether she  knows    is another question.::	0
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"me010"::	So are the people going to be identified by name?::	0
"me011"::	Well, what we're gonna - we'll anonymize it in the transcript.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Um, but not in the audio.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. So, then in terms of people worrying about,::	0
"me011"::	So the-::	0
"me010"::	uh, excising::	0
"me010"::	things from the transcript, it's unlikely.::	0
"me010"::	Since it - it does- isn't attributed.::	0
"me010"::	Oh,  I  see, but the a- but the - but the -::	0
"me011"::	Right, so if I said, "Oh, hi Jerry, how are you?", we're not gonna go through and cancel out the "Jerry"s.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Sure.::	0
"me011"::	Um, so we  will  go through and, in the speaker I_D tags there'll be, you know, M_one O_ seven, M_one O_ eight.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Um, but uh,::	0
"me011"::	um, it w- uh, I don't know a good way of doing it on the  audio,  and still have people who are doing  discourse  research be able to use the data.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm. No, I - I wasn't complaining, I just wanted to understand.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Well, we can make up aliases for each of us.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I mean, whatever you wanna do is fine, but we find that - We  want  the meeting to be as natural as possible.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me012"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	So, we're trying to do  real  meetings.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	And so we don't wanna have to do aliases and we don't want people to be editing what they say.::	0
"mn015"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	So I think that it's  better  just as a pro- post-process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft. You know?::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Um, O_K. So why  don't  you tell us briefly::	0
"me010"::	your - give - give your e- normal schpiel.::	0
"me011"::	O_K. So th-::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	So this is - The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project. Um.::	0
"me011"::	So  my  particular interest is in the P_D_A of the future.::	0
"me011"::	This is a mock-up of one. Yes, we do believe the P_D_A of the future will be made of wood.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	The idea is that you'd be able to put a P_D_A at the table at an impromptu meeting,::	0
"me011"::	and record it,::	0
"me011"::	and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting.::	0
"me011"::	So that's my particular interest, is a portable device to do m- uh, information retrieval on meetings.::	0
"me011"::	Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings.::	0
"me011"::	Um. So the first step on that, in  any  of these, is to collect some data.::	0
"me011"::	And so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both::	0
"me011"::	the table top microphones, and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes,::	0
"me011"::	as well as the close talking mikes.::	0
"me011"::	What the close talk- ng- talking mikes gives us is some ground truth,::	0
"me011"::	gives us, um, high quality audio,::	0
"me011"::	um, especially for people who aren't interested in the  acoustic  parts of this corpus. So, for people who are more interested in language,::	0
"me011"::	we didn't want to  penalize  them by having only the far field mikes available.::	0
"me011"::	And then  also,  um, it's a very, very hard task in terms of speech recognition.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	And so, uh, on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results.::	0
"me011"::	So we wanted the near field mikes to at least  isolate  the difference between the two.::	0
"me011"::	So that's why we're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time.::	0
"me011"::	And then,  all  these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed  synchronously   so that you can also do things like, um, beam-forming on all the microphones and do research like that.::	0
"me011"::	Our intention is to release this data to the public,::	0
"me011"::	um, probably through f- through a body like the L_D_C.::	0
"me011"::	And, uh, just make it as a generally available corpus.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	There's other work going on in meeting recording. So, we're - we're working with S_R_I,::	0
"me011"::	with U_W,::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	NIST has started an effort which will include video.::	0
"me011"::	We're not including video, obviously.::	0
"me011"::	And uh -::	0
"me011"::	and then also, um, a small amount of assistance from I_B_M.::	0
"me011"::	Is also involved.::	0
"me011"::	Um.  Oh,  and the  digit  strings, this is just a more constrained  task.  Um.::	0
"me011"::	So because the general environment is so challenging, we decided to - to do at least one set of digit strings::	0
"me011"::	to give ourselves something easier. And it's exactly the same digit strings as in T_I-digits, which is a::	0
"me011"::	common connected digits corpus. So we'll have some, um, comparison to be able to be made.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Anything else?::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, so when the l- last person comes in, just have  them   wear a wireless. It should be on already.::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	Either one of those. And uh, read the digit strings and - and fill out the forms. So, the most important form is the consent form, so just be s- be sure everyone signs that,  if  they consent.::	0
"mn015"::	I'm sure it's pretty usual for meetings that people come late, so you will have  to leave  what you  set .::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	And uh, just give me a call, which, my number's up there when your meeting is over.::	0
"me010"::	Yep.::	0
"me011"::	And - I'm going to leave the mike here but it's n-::	0
"me011"::	Uh, but I'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one.::	0
"me011"::	It'll just be sitting here.::	0
"me011"::	Thank you.::	0
"mn015"::	Input?::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah. There we go.::	0
"me010"::	By the way, Adam, we will be using the, uh,::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me010"::	screen as well. So, you know.::	0
"me010"::	Wow!::	0
"me010"::	Organization.::	0
"me010"::	So you guys who got email about this  oh f- uh, Friday or something about what we're up to.::	0
"me003"::	No.::	0
"me012"::	No.::	0
"mn015"::	I  got it.::	0
"me003"::	What was the nature of the email?::	0
"me010"::	Oh, this was about::	1
"me010"::	um, inferring intentions from features  in  context,::	0
"me010"::	and the  words,   like "s- go to see", or "visit", or some-::	1
"mn015"::	Wel- we- I - uh - I - I -  @@::	0
"me010"::	You didn't get it?::	0
"me003"::	I don't  think  I did.::	0
"me010"::	I guess these g- have got better filters.::	0
"me010"::	Cuz I sent it to everybody.::	0
"me010"::	You just blew it off. O_K.::	0
"me003"::	Ah.::	0
"mn015"::	It's really simple though. So this is the idea.::	0
"mn015"::	Um.::	0
"mn015"::	We could pursue,::	0
"mn015"::	um,::	0
"mn015"::	if we thought it's - it's worth it but, uh, I think we - we will  agree  on that,::	0
"mn015"::	um, to come up with a - with a sort of very, very first crude prototype,::	0
"mn015"::	and do some implementation work, and do some - some research, and some modeling. So the idea is::	0
"mn015"::	if you want to go somewhere,::	0
"mn015"::	um, and::	0
"mn015"::	focus on that object down -::	0
"mn015"::	Oh, I can actually walk with this. This is nice.::	0
"mn015"::	down here.::	0
"mn015"::	That's the Powder-Tower.::	0
"mn015"::	Now, um,::	0
"mn015"::	we found in our, uh,::	0
"mn015"::	data and from experiments, that::	0
"mn015"::	there's three things you can do.::	0
"mn015"::	Um,::	0
"mn015"::	you can walk::	0
"mn015"::	this  way,::	0
"mn015"::	and come really, really close to it.::	0
"mn015"::	And touch it.::	0
"mn015"::	But you cannot enter or do anything else. Unless you're interested in rock climbing,::	0
"mn015"::	it won't do you no good standing there. It's just a dark alley. But you can touch it.::	0
"mn015"::	If you want to actually go  up  or  into  the tower, you have to go  this  way, and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth.::	0
"mn015"::	If you actually want to  see::	0
"mn015"::	the tower,::	0
"mn015"::	and that's what actually  most  people want to do, is just have a good look of it, take a picture for the family,::	0
"mn015"::	you have to go  this  way, and go up here.::	0
"mn015"::	And there you have a vre- really view - It exploded, the - during the Thirty -years-war. Really uh, interesting sight.::	0
"me003"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn015"::	And um,::	0
"mn015"::	these uh -::	0
"mn015"::	these lines are, um,  paths,  or so-::	0
"mn015"::	That's ab- er, i-::	1
"mn015"::	the  street  network of our geographic information system.::	1
"mn015"::	And you can tell that we::	0
"mn015"::	deliberately cut out this part.::	0
"mn015"::	Because otherwise we couldn't get our G_I_S system to take - to lead people this way.::	0
"mn015"::	It would always use the closest point to the object, and then the tourists would be faced, you know, in front of a wall, but it would do them absolutely no good.::	1
"mn015"::	So,::	1
"mn015"::	what we found interesting is, first of all,::	0
"mn015"::	intentions differ.::	1
"mn015"::	Maybe you want to  enter  a building.::	1
"mn015"::	Maybe you want to  see  it, take a  picture  of it.::	1
"mn015"::	Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building. For whatever reason that may be.::	1
"me003"::	What's it - what's it made out of?::	0
"mn015"::	Um, r- red limestone.::	0
"me003"::	So maybe you  would  wanna touch it.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, maybe you would want to touch it. Um.::	0
"mn015"::	Okay, I - This, um -::	0
"mn015"::	These intentions, we - w- w- we  could,::	0
"mn015"::	if we want to,::	0
"mn015"::	call it the - the Vista mode,::	0
"mn015"::	where we just want to - eh - s- get the overview or look at it,::	0
"mn015"::	the Enter mode,::	0
"mn015"::	and the, well, Tango mode. I always come up with - with silly names. So this "Tango" means, literally translated, "to touch".::	0
"mn015"::	So - But sometimes the - the Tango mode is really relevant in the - in the sense that, um,::	0
"mn015"::	if you want to, uh -::	0
"mn015"::	If you don't have the intention of  entering  your building,::	1
"mn015"::	but you know that something is really  close  to it,::	0
"mn015"::	and you just want to  approach  it, or get  to  that building.::	1
"mn015"::	Consider, for example, the Post Office in Chicago, a building so large that it has its own  zip  code.::	0
"mn015"::	So the  entrance  could be  miles  away::	0
"mn015"::	from the closest point.::	0
"mn015"::	So sometimes it m-::	0
"mn015"::	m- m- makes sense maybe to d- to distinguish  there.::	0
"mn015"::	So, um,::	0
"mn015"::	I've looked, uh, through::	0
"mn015"::	twenty some -::	0
"mn015"::	Uh, I didn't look through  all  the data.::	0
"mn015"::	um, and there - there's uh, a lot more different::	0
"mn015"::	ways in people - uh, the ways people phrase how to g-::	0
"mn015"::	get -::	0
"mn015"::	if they want to get to a certain place.::	0
"mn015"::	And  sometimes  here it's b- it's a little bit  more  obvious -::	0
"mn015"::	Um.::	0
"mn015"::	Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the -::	0
"me010"::	No, O_K come in, sit down.  If you  grab yourself a microphone.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	You need to sign some stuff and read some digits.::	0
"me010"::	Well, you can sign afterwards.::	0
"mn015"::	O- or later.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"me003"::	You have to al- also have to read some digits.::	0
"me010"::	Afterwards.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. Afterwards is fine.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K, go ahead.::	0
"mn015"::	They  are  uncomfortable.::	0
"fe004"::	@@  Small?::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Really small? O_K. I see.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"fe004"::	Thank you.::	0
"mn015"::	O_K,  but  that was our idea. Is -::	0
"me010"::	And it -  it - it - it- it also has to be switched  on,  Nance.::	0
"me003"::	No,  that  one's already  on,  I thought he said. Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	I - I think -::	0
"me010"::	It's on? O_K, good.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. It's on.::	0
"mn015"::	O_K. That was the idea. Um, people, when they w- when they want to go to a building, sometimes they just want to look at it.::	0
"mn015"::	Sometimes they want to  enter  it. And sometimes they want to get really  close  to it.::	0
"mn015"::	That's something we found.::	0
"mn015"::	It's just a truism.::	1
"mn015"::	And the   places   where you will  lead  them for these intentions::	1
"mn015"::	are sometimes ex- in- incredibly different. I - I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where - if you want to enter it.::	1
"mn015"::	So, this is sort of how people may, uh - may  phrase  those requests to a - a - a mock-up system at least that's the way they did it.::	0
"mn015"::	And we get tons of - of these "how do I get to", "I want to go to", but also, "give me directions to", and "I would like to see".::	1
"mn015"::	And um,::	0
"mn015"::	what we can sort of  do,  if we look  closer   a- closer at the - the data -::	0
"mn015"::	That was the wrong one.::	0
"mn015"::	um, we can look at some factors that may make a difference.::	1
"mn015"::	First of all,::	0
"mn015"::	very important, and um, that -::	0
"mn015"::	I've completely forgot that when we talked.::	0
"mn015"::	This is of course a  crucial  factor, "what type of object is it?"::	1
"mn015"::	So,  some  buildings you just don't want to take pictures of.::	0
"mn015"::	Or very rarely.::	0
"mn015"::	But you usually want to enter them.::	0
"mn015"::	Some objects are  more  picturesque,::	0
"mn015"::	and you - more f- more highly photographed. Then of course the -::	1
"mn015"::	the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants.::	1
"mn015"::	Um.::	1
"mn015"::	Sometimes I found in the - Uh, looking at the data,::	0
"mn015"::	in a  superficial  way, I found some s- sort of  modifiers  that -::	0
"mn015"::	that m- may also give us  a  hint, um,::	1
"mn015"::	"I'm  trying  to get to"::	0
"mn015"::	Nuh? "I  need  to get to".::	0
"mn015"::	Sort of hints to the fact that you're not really::	0
"mn015"::	sightseeing and - and just f- there for pleasure and so forth and so on.::	0
"mn015"::	And this leads us straight to the context::	1
"mn015"::	which  also    should  be considered. That whatever it is you're doing at the moment may also inter-::	1
"mn015"::	influence the interpretation of - of a phrase. So, this is, uh, really uh, uh, uh -::	0
"mn015"::	My suggestion is really simple.::	0
"mn015"::	We start with, um -::	0
"mn015"::	Now,::	0
"mn015"::	Let me, uh, say one more thing. What we  do  know, is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between  any  of these.::	1
"mn015"::	So, basically  all  of these things will result in the same::	0
"mn015"::	X_M_L M_-three-L_ structure.::	0
"mn015"::	Sort of action "go", and then an object. Yeah? and a source. So it's - it's - it's way too crude to d-::	1
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	capture those differences in intentions.::	1
"mn015"::	So, I thought, "Mmm! Maybe for a deep understanding task, that's a nice sort of playground or first little thing."::	1
"mn015"::	Where we can start it and n- sort of look - "O_K, we  need,  we gonna get those M_-three-L_ structures. The crude, undifferentiated parse.::	1
"mn015"::	Interpreted input.::	0
"mn015"::	We may need additional part of speech, or maybe just some information on the verb, and modifiers, auxiliaries.::	0
"mn015"::	We'll see. And I will try to - to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there, and maybe we want to get a g- switch for the context.::	1
"mn015"::	So this is not something which we can actually monitor,::	0
"mn015"::	now,::	0
"mn015"::	but just is something we can set.::	0
"mn015"::	And then you can all imagine sort of a - a constrained satisfaction program, depending on - on what, um, comes out.::	0
"mn015"::	We want to have an - a structure resulting::	0
"mn015"::	if we feed it through a belief-net or - or something along those lines.::	1
"mn015"::	We'd get an inferred intention, we - we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista, the Enter, and the,::	0
"mn015"::	um, Tango mode. Which I think we maybe want to::	1
"mn015"::	ignore. But.::	0
"mn015"::	That's my idea. It's up for discussion.::	0
"mn015"::	We can change all of it, any bit of it.::	0
"mn015"::	Throw it all away.::	0
"me012"::	Now  @@  this email that you sent, actually.::	0
"me010"::	What?::	0
"me012"::	Now  I remember the email.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"me003"::	Huh. Still, I have no::	0
"me003"::	recollection whatsoever of the email. I'll have to go back and check.::	0
"me010"::	Not important.::	0
"me010"::	So, what  is  important is that we::	0
"me010"::	understand what the proposed task::	0
"me010"::	is.::	0
"me010"::	And, the - the i- uh, Robert and I talked about this some on Friday.::	0
"me010"::	And::	0
"me010"::	we  think  it's well-formed.::	0
"me010"::	So we  think  it's a well-formed,::	1
"me010"::	uh, starter task for this,::	0
"me010"::	uh, deeper understanding in the tourist domain.::	1
"me012"::	So, where exactly is the, uh, deeper understanding being done? Like I mean, s- is it before the Bayes-net? Is it, uh -::	0
"me010"::	Well, it's the - it's - it's  always   all  of it.::	0
"me010"::	So, in  general  it's  always  going to be, the answer is,::	0
"me010"::	everywhere.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, so the  notion  is that, uh, this isn't  real  deep.::	0
"me010"::	But it's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th- three quite different kinds of, uh, going to see some tourist thing.::	0
"me010"::	And, so that's - that's the quote "deep" that we're trying to get at. And, Robert's point is that::	0
"me010"::	the current front-end::	0
"me010"::	doesn't give you any way to - Not only doesn't it  do  it,::	0
"me010"::	but it also doesn't  give  you enough information to do it. It isn't like, if you just took what the front-end  gives  you,::	0
"me010"::	and used some clever  inference  algorithm on it, you would be able to figure out which of these is going on.::	0
"me010"::	So,::	0
"me010"::	uh, and this is - Bu- I- in general it's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding, there's gonna be contextual things, there're gonna be linguistic things, there're gonna be discourse things,::	1
"me010"::	and they gotta be combined.::	1
"me010"::	And, my idea on how to  combine  them is with a belief-net, although it may turn out that t- some totally different thing is gonna work better.::	1
"me010"::	Um,::	0
"me010"::	the idea would be that::	0
"me010"::	you, uh,::	0
"me010"::	take your -::	0
"me010"::	You're editing your slide?::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah. As i- a- sort of, as I get ideas, uh w- uh.::	0
"me010"::	Oh.::	0
"mn015"::	So,  discourse  - I - I - I thought about that. Of course that needs to sort of go in there.::	0
"me010"::	Oh.  I'm  sorry. O_K. So. This is minutes - taking minutes as we go,::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me010"::	in his - in his own way.::	0
"me010"::	Um, but the p- the -  Anyway.  So the thing is,::	0
"me010"::	i- uh, d-::	0
"me010"::	naively  speaking,::	0
"me010"::	you've - you've got a -::	0
"me010"::	for this little task, a  belief-net,::	0
"me010"::	which is going to have as  output,::	1
"me010"::	the conditional pr- probability of one of three things,::	1
"me010"::	that the person wants to - uh, to View it, to Enter it, or to Tango with it.::	0
"me010"::	Um.::	0
"me010"::	So that - the - the  output  of the belief-net is::	0
"me010"::	pretty well formed.::	0
"me010"::	And, then the  inputs::	0
"me010"::	are going to be  these  kinds of things.::	0
"me010"::	And, then the question is -::	0
"me010"::	there are  two  questions - is, uh,  one,  where do you get this i-::	1
"me010"::	information from, and  two,  what's the structure of the belief-net?::	1
"me010"::	So what  are  the conditional probabilities::	1
"me010"::	of this, that, and the other, given these things?::	1
"me010"::	And you probably need intermediate nodes. I - we don't know what they are yet.::	1
"me010"::	So it may well be that, uh, for example,::	0
"me010"::	that, uh, knowing whether -::	0
"me010"::	Oh,  another  thing you want::	1
"me010"::	is some information::	0
"me010"::	abou- I  think,::	0
"me010"::	about the time of day.::	1
"me010"::	Now, they may wanna call that part of context.::	0
"me010"::	But the time of day matters a  lot.::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	And, if things are  obviously  closed,::	0
"me010"::	then,::	0
"me010"::	you -::	0
"mn015"::	People won't want to enter it.::	0
"me010"::	Pe- people don't wanna enter them.::	0
"me010"::	And, if it's  not  obvious, you  may  want to actually::	0
"mn015"::	s- b-::	0
"me010"::	uh, point  out  to people that it's closed - you know, what they're g- going to is closed and they don't have the  option  of entering it.::	0
"me010"::	So  another  thing that can come  up,::	0
"me010"::	and  will  come up as soon as you get  serious  about this is,::	0
"me010"::	that another option of course is to::	0
"me010"::	have a - more of a  dialogue.::	0
"me010"::	So if someone says something you could  ask  them.::	0
"me003"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. And - Now, one thing you could do is  always  ask them, but that's boring.::	0
"me010"::	And it also w- it also be a pain for the person using it.::	0
"me010"::	So one thing you could do is build a little system that, said, " whenever  you got a question like that I've got::	1
"me010"::	one of three answers.  Ask  them which one you want."::	1
"me010"::	O_K. But that's, um,  not  what we're gonna do.::	0
"mn015"::	But maybe that's a false state of the system, that it's too close to call.::	0
"me010"::	Oh yeah. You want the - you want the ability to a- You want the  ability  to ask, but what you  don't  wanna do is::	1
"me010"::	onl- build a system that  always  asks  every  time, and i-::	1
"me010"::	That's not getting at the scientific problem, and it's -::	1
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	In general you're - you know,::	0
"me010"::	it's gonna be  much  more  complex  than that.::	0
"me010"::	a- This is  purposely  a  really   simple case.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So, uh - Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	I have one more point to - to Bhaskara's question. Um, I think also the - the - the  deep  understanding part of it is - is going to be in there to the extent that we::	0
"mn015"::	um,  want  it in terms of::	0
"mn015"::	our  modeling.  We can start, you know, basic from::	0
"mn015"::	human beings, model that, its motions,::	0
"mn015"::	going, walking, seeing, we can mem- model all of  that  and then  compose  whatever inferences o- we  make  out of these really conceptual  primitives.::	0
"mn015"::	That will be  extremely  deep in the - in - in - in  my  understanding.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	1
"me010"::	S- so - so the way that  might  come up,::	0
"me010"::	if you wanna - Suppose you wanted to do that, you might say,::	0
"me010"::	"Um, as an  intermediate  step in your belief-net, is there a Source-Path-Goal::	0
"me010"::	schema involved?"::	1
"me010"::	O_K? And if so, uh, is there a focus on the goal? Or is there a focus on the path? or something.::	1
"me010"::	And that could be, uh,::	0
"me010"::	one of the conditiona- you know, th- the -::	0
"me010"::	In some piece of the belief-net, that could be the - the appropriate thing to  enter.::	0
"me012"::	So, where would we extract that information from? From the M_-three-L_?::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"me010"::	No.  See, the M_-three-L_ is not gonna give th- What he was  saying  is,::	1
"me010"::	the M_-three-L_ does not have  any  of that. All it has is some  really  crude stuff saying,::	1
"me012"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	"A person wants to go to a place."::	0
"me003"::	The M_-three-L_ is the old SmartKom output?::	1
"me003"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	1
"me010"::	M_-three- well, M_-three-L_  itself  refers to Multimedia Mark-up Language.::	0
"me003"::	It's just a language. Right, yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So we have th- w- we- we::	0
"me010"::	we have to have a better w- way of referring to -::	0
"mn015"::	The parser output?::	0
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah. The -::	0
"mn015"::	" Analyzed  speech" I think it's what they call it, really,   oder   -::	0
"me010"::	Well, O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	o- th- No, actually, intention lattices is what we're gonna get.::	0
"me010"::	Is- i- but they c- they call it intention lattice, but tha-  Anyway.::	0
"mn015"::	In- in- a- intention lattice k-  Hypothesis.  They call it intention hypotheses.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	So, th- they're gonna give us some cr- uh - or - We can assume that y- you get this crude information.::	1
"me010"::	About intention, and that's all they're going to provide.::	1
"me010"::	And they  don't  give you the kind of object, they don't give you::	1
"me010"::	any discourse history, if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else.::	0
"mn015"::	Well, they keep it. We have to request it.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	Nuh?::	0
"mn015"::	But it's not  in  there.::	0
"me010"::	Well, they - they kee- they keep it by  their  lights. It may - it may or may not::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, or i-::	0
"me010"::	be what - what  we  want. Yeah.::	0
"me003"::	So, if someone says, "I wanna touch the side of the Powder-Tower",::	0
"me003"::	that would -::	0
"me003"::	basically, we need to pop up Tango mode and the -::	0
"me003"::	and the directions?::	0
"me010"::	If i- if - Yeah, if it got as simple as that, yeah. But it wouldn't.::	0
"me003"::	Yeah.::	0
"me003"::	O_K.::	0
"me003"::	But that doesn't necessarily -::	0
"me003"::	But  we'd have to infer a Source-Path-Goal to some degree for::	0
"me003"::	touching the side, right?::	0
"mn015"::	Well -::	0
"mn015"::	Uh, th- the- there is a p- a point there if I understand you. Correct?::	0
"mn015"::	Um,::	0
"mn015"::	because um,::	0
"mn015"::	sometimes  people just say::	0
"mn015"::	things -  This  you find very often. "Where is the city hall?"::	0
"mn015"::	And this do-::	0
"mn015"::	they don't  wanna  sh- see it on a map, or they don't  wanna  know it's five hundred yards away from you, or that it's to the - your north. They wanna  go  there.::	0
"mn015"::	That's what they  say,  is, "Where is it?".::	0
"mn015"::	Where  is  that damn thing?::	0
"me003"::	And the parser would output -::	0
"mn015"::	Well, that's::	0
"mn015"::	a - a  question  mark. sh-::	0
"mn015"::	A lot of parsers, um,::	1
"mn015"::	just, uh -::	0
"mn015"::	That's  way  beyond their scope, is - of interpreting that. You know?::	1
"mn015"::	But um,::	0
"mn015"::	still outcome w- the outcome will be some form of structure,::	0
"mn015"::	with the town hall and maybe saying it's a W_H focus on the town hall. But to  interpret  it,::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	you know? somebody  else  has to do  that  job  later.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me003"::	I'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output,::	0
"me003"::	depending on these  things.::	0
"mn015"::	Um, it will probably tell you how far away it is, at least that's - That's even what Deep Map does. It tells you how far away it is, and - and shows it to you on a map.::	0
"mn015"::	Because i- we can not differentiate, at the  moment,  between, you know, the intention of wanting to  go  there or the intention of just know- wanting to know where - where it  is.::	1
"fe004"::	People  no- might not be able to infer that  either,  right? Like the fact -::	0
"fe004"::	Like, I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked, "Where's the city hall?",::	0
"fe004"::	I might say, g- ar- "Are you trying to  get  there?"::	0
"fe004"::	Because how I describe::	0
"fe004"::	um, t- its location - uh, p- probably depend on whether I think I should give them, you know, directions now, or::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	@@::	0
"fe004"::	say, you know, whatever, "It's half a mile away" or something like that.::	0
"mn015"::	It's a granularity factor, because where people ask you, "Where is New  York? ", you will tell them it's on the East  Coast.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah .::	0
"fe004"::	Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	Y- y- eh - you won't tell them how to  get  there, ft- you know, take that bus to the airport and blah-blah-blah.::	0
"fe004"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	But if it's the  post  office, you will tell them how to  get  there.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	So th-::	0
"mn015"::	They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well. So.::	0
"fe004"::	Right. Right.::	0
"me010"::	But  -::	0
"me010"::	i- Go - go back to the - the uh, th-::	0
"me010"::	Yeah,  that  slide.::	0
"mn015"::	So I w- this is - "onto" is - is knowledge about buildings, their opening times,::	0
"mn015"::	and then t- coupled with time of day,::	0
"mn015"::	um,::	0
"mn015"::	this should -::	0
"mn015"::	You know .::	0
"fe004"::	So that context was like, um, their presumed  purpose  context, i- like business or travel,::	0
"fe004"::	as  well  as the utterance context, like, "I'm now standing at this place at this time".::	0
"me010"::	Yeah, well I think we ought to d-::	1
"me010"::	a- As we have all along, d-::	0
"me010"::	We - we've been distu-::	0
"me010"::	distinguishing between  situational  context, which is what you have as context,::	1
"me010"::	and  discourse  context, which you have as D_H, I don't know what the H_ means.::	1
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	Nuh.::	0
"mn015"::	History.::	0
"mn015"::	Discourse history.::	0
"me010"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Whatever.::	0
"me010"::	So we can work out terminology later.::	0
"mn015"::	Yep.::	0
"me010"::	So, they're - they're quite distinct.::	0
"me010"::	I mean, you  need  them both, but they're quite  distinct.::	0
"me010"::	And, so what we were  talking  about doing, a- a- as a  first  shot,::	0
"me010"::	is  not   doing  any of the  linguistics.::	0
"me010"::	Except to find out what seems to be   useful.::	0
"me010"::	So, the - the - the reason the  belief-net  is in  blue,::	0
"me010"::	is the notion would be -::	0
"me010"::	Uh, this may be a bad dis- bad  idea,  but the idea is::	1
"me010"::	to take as a first  goal,::	0
"me010"::	see if we could actually  build  a belief-net::	0
"me010"::	that  would  make this three way distinction::	0
"me010"::	uh, in a plausible  way,  given::	1
"me010"::	these - We have all these transcripts and we're able to,::	1
"me010"::	by  hand,  extract the features to put in the belief-net. Saying, "Aha! here're the things which, if you  get  them out of - out of the language and discourse, and put them into the  belief-net,  it would tell you::	1
"me010"::	which of these three uh,  intentions  is most  likely. "::	1
"me010"::	And if - to actually  do  that, build it, um - you know, run it - y- y- run it on the  data  where you hand-transcribe::	1
"me010"::	the parameters.::	1
"me010"::	And see how that goes.::	0
"me010"::	If that goes  well,::	1
"me010"::	then we can start worrying about how we would::	0
"me010"::	extract  them.::	1
"me010"::	So - where would you  get  this information?::	0
"me010"::	And,  expand it to - to other things  like  this.::	1
"me010"::	But if we  can't  do that,::	1
"me010"::	then we're in  trouble.::	1
"me010"::	I mean th- th- i- i- if you  can't  do  this  task,::	0
"me010"::	um -::	0
"mn015"::	We need a different, uh,  engine.   Machine,  I mean.::	0
"me010"::	Uh,  uh , yeah, or  something.  Well it - i- I- if it - if it's the  belief-nets,  we- we'll switch to you know,  logic  or some terrible thing, but::	0
"me010"::	I don't think that's gonna be the case. I think that,::	1
"me010"::	uh, if we can get the information,::	0
"me010"::	a belief-net is a perfectly  good  way of::	0
"me010"::	doing the::	0
"me010"::	inferential  combination  of it.::	1
"me010"::	The  real  issue is, do- what  are  the factors involved in  determining  this?::	1
"me010"::	And I don't  know.::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	But,  only w-::	0
"me010"::	Hold on a s- Hold on a second.::	0
"mn015"::	Muh .::	0
"me010"::	So,  I  know  . Uh, uh, is it clear what's going on here?::	0
"me012"::	Yep.::	0
"fe004"::	Um, I missed the beginning, but, um::	0
"fe004"::	I guess - could you back to the slide, the  previous  one? So, is it that it's, um -::	0
"fe004"::	These are all factors that uh, a-::	0
"fe004"::	These are the ones that you said that we are going to  ignore  now? or that we want to::	0
"fe004"::	take into account? You were saying::	0
"fe004"::	n-::	0
"me010"::	Take  them into  account.::	0
"fe004"::	Take the - the linguistic factors  too.::	0
"me010"::	But - but you  don't  worry about - h-::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, how to  extract  these features. O_K.::	0
"me010"::	how to  extract   them.::	0
"me010"::	So, f- let's find out which ones we  need  first,::	0
"fe004"::	Got it.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K.::	1
"fe004"::	And - and it's clear from the data, um, like, sorta the correct answer in each case.::	1
"me010"::	and -::	0
"fe004"::	But l-::	0
"me010"::	No.::	0
"fe004"::	O_K. That's - that's the thing I'm curious ab-::	0

"mn015"::	we  can,  then, get::	0
"mn015"::	sort of empirically validated data.::	0

"mn015"::	s- sometimes when people want to just  see  it, they phrase it  more  like this?::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally  differently,  even if they  still  -  you know?::	0
"fe004"::	Right.::	0

"fe004"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	So, um, this is exactly  what  - Because y- you can  never  be sure. And I'm sure even i- the most, sort of, deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say, "Well, if it's phrased like that,::	1

"me010"::	we may want to push  that  effort to get information we need.::	0

"me010"::	is to figure out how to  solve  these problems.::	0
"me010"::	If it turns out that we need data of a certain  sort,  then::	0
"me010"::	the sort of data collection branch::	0

"fe004"::	I guess I don't know - The situation of - of collecting th- the data of, like - Here you could imagine them being - walking around the city.::	0

"mn015"::	But -::	1
"mn015"::	It was never th- th- the goal of  that  data collection to - to serve for sat- for such a purpose. So that's why for example the tasks were not::	1
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	differentiated by intentionality, there was n- there was no  label,  you know, intention A_, intention B_, intention C_. Or task A_, B_, C_.::	1

"mn015"::	u- u- Sort of  I'm,  at the moment, curious and I'm - I'm - s- w- want to approach it from the end where we can s- sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with,::	1
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0

"mn015"::	Ultimately  once we  are   all  experts in changing that  parser,  for example, maybe, there's just a couple three things we need to  do  and then we get more whatever, part of speech and more construction-type-like::	0

"mn015"::	stuff out of it.::	0
"mn015"::	It's a m- pragmatic approach, uh, at the moment.::	0
"me003"::	How exactly does the data collection work? Do they have a map,::	1
"me003"::	and then you give  them   a scenario of some sort?::	0

"me010"::	it would just be, "O_K, if you can be sure that it's a tourist, versus a businessman, versus a  native, "::	0
"me010"::	or something,::	0
"me010"::	uh, that would give you::	0
"me010"::	a  lot  of  discriminatory   power and then just have a little section in your belief-net that said, "pppt!"::	0
"me010"::	Though sin- f- in the  short  run, you'd  set  them,::	1
"me012"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	and see ho- how it worked, and then in the longer run,::	1
"me010"::	you would figure out how you could  derive  them.::	0
"me012"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	From previous discourse or w- any- anything else you  knew.::	1
"me012"::	So, how should - What's the uh, plan? Like, how should we go about figuring out these -::	0
"me010"::	O_K. So, first of all is, uh, do e- either of you guys,::	1
"me010"::	you got a favorite belief-net that you've, you know, played with? JavaBayes or something?::	1
"me012"::	Oh.::	0
"me012"::	No, not really.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. Well, anyway. f-  Get  one.::	0
"me010"::	O_K? So - y- so one of th- one of the things we wanna do is actually,::	1
"me010"::	uh, pick a package,::	1
"me010"::	doesn't matter which one,::	0
"me010"::	uh, presumably one that's got good interactive abilities, cuz a  lot  of what we're gonna be d-::	0
"me010"::	You know, we don't need the one that'll solve massive,::	1
"me010"::	uh, belief-nets quickly. d- w-::	1
"me010"::	These are not gonna get big in - in the foreseeable future.::	0
"me010"::	But we  do  want one::	1
"me010"::	in which it's easy to interact with and, uh, modify.::	1
"me010"::	Because i- that's - A  lot  of what it's gonna be, is,::	0
"me010"::	um,::	0
"me010"::	playing with this. And  probably  one in which it's easy to have,::	1
"me010"::	um, what amounts to transcript files. So that if - if we have all these  cases  -::	1
"me010"::	O_K? So we make up cases that have these features,::	0
"me010"::	O_K, and then you'd like to be able to say, "O_K, here's a bunch of cases" -::	0
"me010"::	There're  even  ones tha- that you can do  learning::	0
"me010"::	O_K? So you have all their cases and - and their results and you have a - algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the - the probabilities for you.::	0
"me010"::	Um,::	0
"me010"::	probably that's not worth it.::	0
"me010"::	I mean, my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that's good enough to make::	0
"me010"::	the - these data fitting ones::	0
"me010"::	worth it, but I don't know.::	0
"me010"::	So I would say you guy- the first task for you two guys is to um, pick a package.::	0
"me010"::	O_K, and you wanna it s- You know, the  standard  things you want it stable, you want it - yeah,  @@ .::	1
"me010"::	And, as soon as we  have  one, we can start::	1
"mn015"::	An-   Nuh.::	0
"me010"::	trying to,::	0
"me010"::	uh,::	0
"me010"::	make a first cut::	0
"me010"::	at what's going on.::	1
"me010"::	But it - what I like about it is it's very  concrete.::	0
"me010"::	O_K? We - we have a - we  know  what the outcomes are gonna be, and we have some - some data that's loose, we can use our own intuition,::	1
"me010"::	and see how  hard  it is,::	0
"me010"::	and,  importantly,  what intermediate nodes we think we  need.::	0
"me010"::	So it - if it turns out that just, thinking about the problem, you come up with things you really need to -::	1
"me010"::	You know,  this  is the kind of thing that is, you know, an intermediate little piece in your belief-net.::	0
"me010"::	That'd be really interesting.::	1
"me003"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	And it - and it may serve as a platform for::	0
"mn015"::	a person, maybe me, or whoever, who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis.::	0
"mn015"::	I mean, w- we have the For- FrameNet group here,  and  we can see what they have found out about those concepts already,::	0
"mn015"::	that are contained in the data,::	0
"mn015"::	um,::	0
"mn015"::	you know, to come up with a nice little set of features and um,::	0
"mn015"::	maybe even means of s- uh, extracting them.::	0
"mn015"::	And - and that altogether could also be - uh, become a nice paper that's going to be published somewhere, if we sit down and  write  it.::	0
"mn015"::	And um -::	0
"mn015"::	When you said JavaBayes belief-net you were talking about ones that run on coffee? or that are in the program  language   Java?::	0
"me010"::	No, th- It turns out that there is a,::	0
"me010"::	uh -::	0
"me010"::	The new end of Java libraries. O_K, and it turns out one called JavaBayes. Which is::	0
"mn015"::	Mmm. O_K.::	0
"me010"::	one that fair - people around here use a fair amount.::	0
"me010"::	I have no idea whether that's -::	0
"me010"::	@@::	0
"me010"::	The obvious  advantage  of that is that you can then,::	0
"me010"::	relatively easily, get all the  other  Java packages for  GUIs   or whatever else you might want to do. So that i- that's I think why::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	a lot of people doing research  use  that.::	0
"me010"::	But  it   may  not  be - I have  no  idea whether that's the best choice an- and::	1
"me010"::	there're plenty of people around, students in the department who, you know, live and  breathe  Bayes-nets. So, uh,::	1
"fe004"::	There's the m-::	0
"fe004"::	tool kit that um, Kevin Murphy has developed,::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"fe004"::	which might be useful too. And it's available Matlab code.::	0
"me010"::	It's O_K.::	0
"me012"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	So, yeah, Kevin would be a good person to start with.::	0
"me010"::	Nancy  knows him well. I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not, but, uh -::	0
"mn015"::	Mm-hmm. But i-::	0
"me012"::	Yeah, I know him.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	But since we all probably are pretty sure that, um, the -::	0
"mn015"::	For example,::	1
"mn015"::	this th- th- the dialogue history is - is um, producing X_M_L documents. M_-three-L_ of course is X_M_L.::	1
"mn015"::	And the ontology that um, uh the student is - is constructing for me back in - in E_M_L is in OIL and that's also in X_M_L.::	1
"mn015"::	And so that's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries, about hotels, about castles and stuff is gonna come from.::	1
"me010"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Um, so, if it has that I_O capability and if it's a Java package, it will definitely be able - We can couple.::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	So, yeah, we're sort of  committed to X_M_L as the kind of,::	1
"me010"::	uh, interchange.::	1
"me010"::	But that's, you know, not a big deal.::	0
"mn015"::	Who isn't, nuh?::	0
"me010"::	So, in terms of - of - interchanging in and  out  of any module  we  build,::	0
"me010"::	It 'll be X_M_L.::	0
"me010"::	And if you're going off to queries to the ontology, for example, you'll have to deal with  its  interface.::	0
"me010"::	But that's - that's fine an- and um,::	0
"me010"::	all of these things have been built::	0
"me010"::	with::	0
"me010"::	much  bigger projects than this in mind. So they - they::	0
"me010"::	have worked very hard. It's kind of blackboards and multi-wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a- And so forth.::	0
"me010"::	So,::	0
"me010"::	that  I don't think is  even  worth us  worrying  about just yet.::	0
"me010"::	I mean if we can get the  core  of the thing to  work,::	0
"me010"::	in a way that we're  comfortable  with,::	0
"me010"::	then we ca- we can get in and out of it with, uh, X_M_L,::	0
"me010"::	um, little descriptors.::	0
"me010"::	I  believe. I don't - I don't see -::	0
"mn015"::	Hmm. Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, I like, for example, the - what you said about the::	0
"mn015"::	getting input from - from just files about where you h- where you have the data, have specified the features and so forth.::	0
"mn015"::	That's, of course,  easy  also to do with, you know, X_M_L.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, you could have an X_ - yeah, you could make and X_M_L format for that. Sure.::	0
"mn015"::	So r-::	0
"me010"::	That - that -::	0
"me010"::	um,::	0
"me010"::	you know, feature value X_M_L format::	0
"me010"::	is  probably as good a way as any.::	0
"me010"::	So it's als- Yeah, I guess it's also worth,::	0
"me010"::	um, while you're poking around, poke around for X_M_L packages that::	0
"me010"::	um,::	0
"me010"::	do things you'd like.::	0
"me012"::	Doesn't - does SmartKom system have such packages?::	0
"me010"::	Sure.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	The - the lib- M_-three-L_ library does that.::	0
"mn015"::	It's also -::	0
"me010"::	And the question is, d- you c- you - you'll have to l-::	0
"me010"::	We'll have to l-::	0
"me010"::	That should be - ay- We should be able to look at that -::	0
"mn015"::	No, u- u- y- um- the -::	0
"mn015"::	What I - What sort of came to  my  mind i- is - was the notion of an idea that::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	if - if there are l- nets that can actually lear- try to set their own, um,::	0
"mn015"::	probability factors based on - on - on - on input -::	0
"mn015"::	which is in file format,::	0
"mn015"::	if we,::	1
"mn015"::	um, get  really  w- wild on this, we may actually want to use some - some corpora that  other  people made and, for example, if - if they are in - in  MATE,::	1
"mn015"::	then we get X_M_ L  documents with discourse annotations, t- you know, t- from the discourse act down to the phonetic level.::	1
"me012"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	Um,  Michael   has a project where - you know, recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE, and so::	0
"mn015"::	they're actually annotating data and data and data.::	0
"mn015"::	So if we w-::	0
"mn015"::	if we  think  it's  worth  it one of these days,::	0
"mn015"::	not - not with this first prototype but maybe with a  second,  and we have the possibility of - of taking input that's generated  elsewhere  and  learn  from that,::	0
"me012"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	that'd be  nice.::	0
"me010"::	It'd be nice, but - but I - I - I do- I  don't  wanna count on it.::	1
"me010"::	I mean, you can't - you can't run your project based on the speculation that -::	0
"mn015"::	No, no, uh, just for -::	0
"me010"::	that the data will come, and you don't have to actually design the nets.::	0
"mn015"::	Nuh. Just a back door that -::	0
"mn015"::	I - I think we should devote m-::	0
"me010"::	Could  happen. Yeah. So in terms of - of the, um -::	1
"me010"::	the - what the SmartKom gives us for M_-three-L_ packages, it could be that they're fine, or it could be eeh.  You don't -::	1
"me010"::	You know, you don't really  like  it.::	0
"me010"::	So we're not - we're not abs- we're not  required  to use::	1
"me010"::	their packages. We  are  required at the end to give them stuff in their  format,  but hey.::	1
"me012"::	Right.::	0
"me010"::	Um,::	0
"me010"::	it's, uh -::	0
"me010"::	It doesn't control what you do in- you know,  internally.::	0
"mn015"::	@@::	0
"me003"::	What's the time frame for this?::	1
"mn015"::	Two days?::	0
"me010"::	Huh?::	0
"mn015"::	Two, three days?::	0
"me010"::	Yeah bu- w- I'd like that this - y- yeah, this  week,  to ha- to n- to::	1
"me010"::	have y- guys, uh, you know, pick::	0
"me010"::	the - y- you know, belief-net package and tell us what it is, and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something.::	1
"mn015"::	No.::	0
"me012"::	Sure.::	0
"me010"::	And, then as soon as we  have  it,::	1
"me010"::	I think we should start::	0
"me010"::	trying to::	0
"me010"::	populate  it for this  problem.::	1
"me010"::	Make a first cut at, you know, what's going on,::	0
"me010"::	and probably the ea-::	0
"me010"::	easiest  way to do that::	0
"me010"::	is::	0
"me010"::	some on-line way. I mean, you can f- figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or - You know, how-::	0
"mn015"::	Uh - I - I - I - um, O_K, I - t-::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah. I was actually more  joking.  With the two or three days. So this was - was a usual jo-::	0
"me010"::	O_K, I wasn't.::	0
"mn015"::	Um, it will take as long as y- y- yo- you guys  need  for that. But um,::	0
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"me010"::	Right.::	0
"mn015"::	maybe it might be interesting if - if the two of you can agree on who's gonna be the speaker  next  Monday, to  tell  us something about the net you  picked,  and what it does, and how it does that.::	0
"me010"::	Well, y- Well, or  both  of them speak.  We  don't care.::	0
"me012"::	Sure.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, or you can split it up.::	0
"mn015"::	So, y-::	0
"me012"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	So that will be sort of the assignment for next week, is to -::	0
"mn015"::	to -  for  slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and - and how far you've gotten. Pppt!::	0
"me010"::	Well, I'd like to also,::	1
"me010"::	though, uh, ha- have a first cut at what the::	0
"me010"::	belief-net  looks  like.::	1
"me010"::	Even  if it's  really  crude.::	1
"me010"::	O_K? So, you know,::	0
"me010"::	here a- here are -::	0
"me003"::	So we're supposed to  @@  about features and whatnot, and -::	0
"me010"::	Right. Yeah.::	0
"me012"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me010"::	And, as I said, what I'd  like  to do is,::	0
"me010"::	I mean, what would be  really  great is  you  bring it in - If - if - if we could,::	0
"me010"::	uh, in the meeting, say, you know, "Here's the package, here's the current one we have,"::	0
"me010"::	uh, you know, "What other ideas do you have?"::	0
"me010"::	and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file.::	0
"me010"::	Of,::	0
"me010"::	uh, you know, get a - t- a p- tentative format for it, let's say X_M_L, that says, l- you know, "These are::	0
"me010"::	the various  scenarios  we've experienced."::	0
"me010"::	We can just add to that and there'll be this -::	0
"me010"::	this file of them and when you::	0
"me010"::	think you've got a better  belief-net,::	0
"me010"::	You just run it against this, um -::	0
"me010"::	this  data  file.::	0
"me012"::	So we'll be like, hand, uh,::	1
"me012"::	doing all the probabilities.::	1
"me012"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	Oh, yeah, unt- until we know more.::	1
"me003"::	And  what's the relation  to  this with -::	0
"me003"::	Changing  the table so that the system works in English?::	0
"mn015"::	O_K. So this is -::	0
"mn015"::	Whi- while  you  were doing  this,::	0
"mn015"::	I received two lovely emails. The - the full N_T and the full Linux version are::	0
"mn015"::	there.::	0
"mn015"::	I've downloaded them both,::	0
"mn015"::	and I started to unpack the Linux one -::	0
"mn015"::	Uh, the N_T one worked fine.   and I started unta- pack the Linux one, it told me that I can't really unpack it because it  contains   a future date.::	0
"mn015"::	So this is the time difference between Germany. I had to wait until one o'clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it.::	0
"mn015"::	Now, um -::	0
"mn015"::	Then it will be  my  job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on  this  machine.::	0
"mn015"::	And so that we have it.::	0
"mn015"::	And then um -::	0
"mn015"::	Hopefully that - hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along,::	0
"mn015"::	we - I control p-::	1
"mn015"::	Maybe that's what  I  will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show::	1
"me010"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn015"::	that.::	1
"me010"::	Yeah. So the answer, Johno, is that these are,::	0
"me010"::	at the  moment,::	0
"me010"::	separate.::	0
"me010"::	Uh, what one  hopes  is that::	1
"me010"::	when  we understand how the analyzer  works,  we can both::	0
"me010"::	worry about converting it to  English  and worry about how it could ex- extract the parameters we need for the  belief-net.::	1
"me003"::	I guess my question was more about time frame. So we're gonna do belief-nets this week, and then -::	0
"me010"::	Oh, yeah. I don't know. n-  None  of this is i- n-::	1
"me010"::	Neither  of these projects::	0
"me010"::	has got a real tight  time-line,  in the sense that over the next month there's a - there's a deliverable.::	1
"me003"::	O_K.::	0
"me010"::	O_K. S- so uh, it's opportu- in that sense it's opportunistic.::	0
"me010"::	If - if - you know, if we don't get any information for these guys f- for several  weeks  then we aren't gonna sit around,::	0
"me010"::	you know, wasting time,::	0
"me010"::	trying to do the problem or guess what  they  -::	0
"me010"::	You know, just pppt!  go on and do other things.::	0
"me003"::	O_K.::	0
"mn015"::	Yeah, but uh - but the uh -::	1
"mn015"::	This point is really - I think very, very valid that ultimately we hope that -::	0
"mn015"::	that both will merge into a harmonious and, um, wonderful,::	0
"mn015"::	um, state where::	1
"mn015"::	we can  not  only do the bare necessities, I_E, changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German,::	0
"mn015"::	but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say, "O_K, this is what it  usually  does,::	1
"mn015"::	and now we add  this  little thing to it",::	1
"mn015"::	you know? whatever, Johno's and Bhaskara's great belief-net,::	1
"mn015"::	and we plug it  in,::	0
"mn015"::	and then for these certain tasks,::	1
"mn015"::	and  we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a  core  domain of the new system,::	1
"mn015"::	it all - all of a sudden it does much  better.::	1
"mn015"::	Nuh?   Because it can::	0
"mn015"::	produce better answers,::	0
"mn015"::	tell the person, as I s- showed you on this map,::	0
"mn015"::	n- you know, produce either you know, a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door,::	0
"mn015"::	which would be  great.::	0
"mn015"::	So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately, if you  produce  a system like this, it::	1
"mn015"::	takes the person where it wants to  go.::	1
"mn015"::	Rather than taking him::	1
"mn015"::	always to the geometric  center  of a building, which is what they do now.::	1
"me012"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn015"::	And we even had to take  out  a bit.::	0
"mn015"::	Nancy, you  missed  that part.::	0
"mn015"::	We had to take out a bit of the  road::	0
"mn015"::	work. So that it  doesn't  take you to the wall::	0
"mn015"::	every time.  So. Um -::	0
"fe004"::	Oh, really?::	0
"mn015"::	So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered,::	0
"mn015"::	which nobody have - has -::	0
"mn015"::	because  car  navigation systems don't really  care.::	0
"mn015"::	You know, they get you to the  beginning  of the street,  some  now do the house number.::	0
"fe004"::	Hmm.::	0
"fe004"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn015"::	But even  that  is problematic. If you go d-::	0
"mn015"::	If you wanna drive to the S_A_P in Waldorf,::	0
"mn015"::	I'm sure the same is true of Microsoft,::	0
"mn015"::	it takes you to the -::	0
"mn015"::	the  address,  whatever, street number blah-blah-blah,::	0
"mn015"::	you are  miles  away from the entrance.::	0
