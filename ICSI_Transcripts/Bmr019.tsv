"me011"::	O_K, we're on.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	So, I mean, everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on.::	0
"me001"::	Alright.::	0
"mn017"::	C- we -::	0
"fe008"::	I see.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, our agenda was quite short.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, could you  close the door, maybe? Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Sure. Two items, which was, uh,::	0
"me011"::	digits and  possibly  stuff on - on, uh, forced alignment, which  Jane  said that Liz and Andreas had in- information on, but they didn't, so.::	0
"me013"::	@@::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	I guess the only other thing, uh, for which I -::	0
"mn017"::	We should do that second, because Liz might join us in time for that.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Um. O_K, so there's digits, alignments, and, um,::	0
"me013"::	I guess the other thing,::	0
"me013"::	which I came unprepared for, uh,::	0
"me013"::	is, uh, to dis- s- s- see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Any - I mean, maybe not.::	0
"me011"::	Digits and alignments.::	0
"me011"::	But -::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"mn017"::	Talk about aligning people's schedules.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I mean - Right. Yeah, I mean, it was -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, it's  forced  alignment of people's schedules.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah. If we're very -::	0
"mn014"::	Forced align.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	With - with - whatever it was, a  month  and a half or something ahead of time, the only time we could find in common -  roughly  in common, was on a Saturday.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Ugh.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	It's pretty sad. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Have - Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of -  in more of the meeting?::	0
"fe008"::	I - I mean, I don't know, if we had the - if we had the telephone on the table -::	0
"me013"::	No. But, h- I mean, he probably has to go  do  something. Right?::	0
"mn017"::	No, actually I - I have to - I have to shuttle  kids from various places to various other places.::	0
"fe008"::	I see.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	So. And I don't have - and I don't, um, have a cell phone so I can't be having a conference call while driving.::	0
"mn014"::	A cell phone?::	0
"fe008"::	No.  It's not good. That's not good.::	0
"me013"::	R- r- right. So we have to - we -::	0
"mn017"::	Plus, it would make for interesting noise - background noise.::	0
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	So we have to equip him with a - with a -  with a head-mounted, uh, cell phone and -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh -::	0
"me011"::	Ye- we- and we'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits, so it could get real -  real car noise.::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.::	0
"me001"::	Take advantage.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	And with the kids in the background. Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	I'll let - I'd let -::	0
"mn017"::	I let, uh, my five-year-old have a try at the digits, eh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So, anyway, I can talk about digits. Um, did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again?::	0
"me011"::	I mean that it was basically - the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well.::	1
"me011"::	Um, and in retrospect that's not as surprising::	0
"me011"::	as maybe i-::	0
"me011"::	it  shouldn't  have been as surprising as I - as - as I  felt  it was.::	0
"me011"::	The lapel mike is a very high-quality microphone.::	0
"me011"::	And as Morgan pointed out, that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and  clothes  rustling  if no one else is  talking.::	0
"mn017"::	Exactly.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Um, so, uh -::	0
"me001"::	It's g- it -::	0
"me013"::	Well, it's - Yeah, sort of the bre- the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that, the lapel's gonna be better on.::	0
"mn014"::	Or the cross-talk.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	The lapel is typically  worse  on the - on clothes rustling, but if no one's rustling their clothes,::	0
"me011"::	Right. I mean, a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits, so it's - it's a very::	0
"me013"::	it's - it's -::	0
"me011"::	different task than sort of the natural. So.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.  You don't move much during reading digits, I think.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me001"::	Probably the fact that it picks up other people's speakers - other people's  talking  is an indication of that it - the fact it  is  a good microphone.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Right. Right.::	0
"me013"::	Right. So in the  digits,  in most - most cases, there weren't other people talking. So.::	0
"me001"::	So.::	0
"mn017"::	D- do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them?::	0
"me013"::	There typically don't, no.::	0
"mn017"::	Because I - I suppose you could  make  some that have sort of - that you have to orient towards::	0
"mn017"::	your mouth, and then it would -::	0
"me011"::	They have a  little  bit, but they're not noise-cancelling. So, uh -::	0
"me013"::	They're - they're  intended  to be omni-directional.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And th- it's - and because you don't know how people are gonna put  them   on, you know.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	So, also, Andreas, on that one the -::	0
"me011"::	the  back  part of it should be right against your head.::	0
"me011"::	And that will he- keep it from flopping aro- up and down as much.::	0
"mn017"::	It is against my head.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um. Yeah, we actually talked about this in the, uh, front-end meeting this morning, too.::	0
"me011"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me013"::	Much the same thing, and - and it was -::	0
"me013"::	uh, I mean,  there  the point of interest to the group was  primarily  that, um,::	0
"me013"::	the, uh - the system that we had that was based on H_T_ K,  that's used by, you know,   all  the participants in Aurora,::	0
"me011"::	Everybody.::	0
"me013"::	was so much  worse::	0
"me013"::	than the - than the S_R_ I.  And the interesting thing is that even though,::	0
"me013"::	yes, it's a digits task and that's a relatively small number of words and::	0
"me013"::	there's a bunch of digits that you train on,::	0
"me013"::	it's just  not  as  good::	0
"me013"::	as having a - a l- very large amount of data and training up a - a - a nice good big::	0
"me013"::	H_M_M. Um, also you had the adaptation in the S_R_I system, which we didn't have in this.::	0
"me013"::	Um. So.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"mn017"::	And we know -::	0
"mn017"::	Di- did I send you some results without adaptation?::	0
"me011"::	No. Or if you did, I didn't include them, cuz it was -::	0
"me013"::	I- s- I think Stephane, uh, had seen them. So -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, I think I did, actually.::	0
"mn017"::	So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Um.::	0
"mn017"::	A - a - a couple percent or some- I mean -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, I don't know it - Overall -::	0
"mn017"::	Uh, I - I don't remember, but there was -  there was a significant,::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	0
"mn017"::	loss or win  from adaptation - with - with adaptation.::	0
"mn017"::	And, um,::	0
"mn017"::	that was the phone-loop adaptation. And then there was a very small -::	0
"mn017"::	like point one percent on the natives - uh, win from doing,::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, adaptation to  the recognition hypotheses.::	0
"mn017"::	And  I tried both means adaptation and means and variances, and the variances added another - or subtracted another point one percent. So,::	0
"mn017"::	it's, um - that's the number there. Point six, I believe, is what you get with::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	both, uh, means and variance adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	But I think one thing is that, uh, I would  presume  -::	0
"me013"::	Hav- Have you ever t-::	0
"me013"::	Have you ever  tried  this exact same recognizer out on the actual T_I-digits test set?::	0
"mn017"::	This exact same recognizer? No.::	0
"me013"::	It might be interesting to do that. Cuz my - my - cuz my sense,::	0
"me013"::	um -::	0
"mn017"::	But - but, I have - I mean, people - people at S_R_I are actually working on digits.::	0
"me011"::	I bet it would do even slightly better.::	0
"mn017"::	I could - and they are using a system that's,::	0
"mn017"::	um -::	0
"mn017"::	you know, h- is actually  trained  on digits,::	0
"mn017"::	um, but h- h- otherwise uses the same,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, decoder, the same,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	uh, training::	0
"mn017"::	methods, and so forth, and I could ask them what they get  on T_I-digits.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, bu- although I'd be - I think it'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable and try it out on T_I-digits.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm. Well, Adam knows how to run it, so you just::	0
"me011"::	Yeah. No problem.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz our sense from the other - from the Aurora, uh, task is that - I mean, cuz we were getting sub one percent::	0
"mn017"::	make a f-::	0
"me011"::	And try it with T_I-digits?::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	numbers on T_I-digits also with the tandem thing. So,::	0
"mn017"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	one - so there were a number of things we noted from this. One is, yeah, the S_R_I system is a lot better than the H_T_K -::	1
"mn017"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	this, you know, very limited training H_T_K system.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, but the other is that, um, the digits::	1
"me013"::	recorded here in this room with these close mikes, i- uh, are actually a lot  harder  than the  studio-recording T_I-digits.::	1
"me013"::	I think, you know, one reason for that, uh, might be that there's still - even though it's close-talking, there still is  some  noise and  some  room acoustics.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And another might be that, uh, I'd - I would  presume  that in the studio, uh, uh, situation recording read speech that if somebody::	0
"me013"::	did something a little funny or n- pronounced something a little funny or made a little - that they didn't include it, they made  them   do it again.::	0
"me011"::	They didn't include it.::	0
"me011"::	Whereas, I took out  the ones that I  noticed  that were blatant - that were correctable.::	0
"me013"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So that, if someone just read the wrong digit, I corrected it. And then there was another one where Jose::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	couldn't tell whether - I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six.  And I asked  him  and he couldn't tell either.::	0
"me026"::	Hmm.::	0
"me011"::	So I just cut it out.::	0
"me011"::	You know, so I just e- edited out the first, i- uh, word of the utterance.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Um, so there's a  little  bit of correction but it's definitely not as clean as T_I-digits.::	0
"me011"::	So my expectations is T_I-digits would, especially -::	0
"me011"::	I think T_I-digits is all  American English. Right? So it would probably do even a little better still::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	on the S_R_I system, but we could give it a try.::	0
"mn017"::	Well. But   remember,  we're using a  telephone  bandwidth front-end here, uh, on this, uh -::	1
"mn017"::	on this S_R_I system, so,::	1
"mn017"::	um, I was - I thought that maybe that's actually a good thing because it - it gets rid of some of the - uh, the noises,::	0
"mn017"::	um, you know, in the -::	0
"mn017"::	the - below and above the -::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	um, the,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, speech bandwidth  and,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	0
"mn017"::	I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher-quality recordings you would have to in fact, uh,::	1
"mn017"::	use models that, uh, were trained on wider-band::	0
"mn017"::	data. And of course we can't do that or -::	1
"me011"::	Wha- what's T_I-digits? I thought t-::	0
"me013"::	It's wide-band, yeah. It's - in - in fact, we looked it up and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling.::	0
"me011"::	It  is  wide-band. O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Oh, that's right. I - I did look that up. I couldn't remember whether that was T_I-digits or one of the other digit tasks.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	But - but, I would - Yeah. It's - it's easy enough to try, just run it on -::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm. So, Morgan, you're getting a little  breath  noise. You might wanna move the mike down a little bit.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	See w-::	0
"mn017"::	Now, eh, does -::	0
"mn017"::	one - one issue -::	0
"mn017"::	one issue with - with that is that::	0
"mn017"::	um, the system has this, uh, notion of a  speaker  to - which is used in adaptation, variance norm- uh, you know,::	0
"mn017"::	both in, uh, mean and variance normalization and also in::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	the V_T_L  estimation. So -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I noticed the script that extracted it.::	0
"mn017"::	Do y- ?::	0
"mn017"::	Is - ?::	0
"mn017"::	So does - so th- so does - does, um,::	0
"mn017"::	the T_I-digits database have speakers that are known?::	0
"me011"::	Yep.  Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	And is there - is there enough data or a comparable - comparable amount of data to - to what we have in our recordings here?::	0
"me011"::	That I don't know.::	0
"me011"::	I don't know.::	0
"me011"::	I don't know how many speakers there are,::	0
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	and - and how many speakers per utterance.::	0
"me013"::	Well, the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	That would -::	0
"mn017"::	Right. Uh, but I'm not so much worried about the adaptation, actually, than - than the, um,::	1
"mn017"::	um -::	0
"mn017"::	the, uh,::	0
"mn017"::	V_T_L estimation.::	0
"mn017"::	If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the -::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	the warping, uh, factor. So, um -::	1
"me011"::	I  strongly  suspect that they have more speakers than we do.::	0
"mn017"::	Right. But it's not the amount of speakers, it's the num- it's the amount of data  per  speaker.::	0
"me011"::	So, uh -::	0
"me011"::	Right. So we - we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	So -::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"me011"::	So, although I - I sort of know how to run it, there are a little - a f- few details here and there that I'll have to  dig out.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K. The key -::	0
"mn017"::	So th- the system actually::	0
"mn017"::	extracts the speaker I_D from the waveform names.::	0
"me011"::	Right. I saw that.::	0
"mn017"::	And there's a - there's a script - and that is actually  all  in one script. So there's this one script that parses waveform names::	0
"mn017"::	and extracts things like the, um, speaker,::	0
"mn017"::	uh, I_D or something that can stand in as a speaker I_D. So,::	1
"mn017"::	we might have to modify that script to recognize the, um, speakers,::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	um, in the - in the, uh, um,  T_I-digits  database.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	And that, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	Or you can fake - you can::	0
"mn017"::	fake  names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the - for the meetings.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	That would be the, sort of - probably the safest way to do -::	0
"me011"::	I might have to do that anyway to - to do - because we may have to do an extract to get the  amount of data per speaker about right.::	1
"mn017"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me011"::	The other thing is, isn't T_I-digits  isolated  digits?::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Or is that another one? I'm - I looked through a  bunch  of the digits t- corp- corpora, and now they're all blurring.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit.::	0
"me011"::	And then others were connected digits.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Most of T_I-digits is connected digits, I think. The - I mean, we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using. It was -::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Maybe it's the Bell  Gram .::	0
"me013"::	that's - that was isolated digits.::	0
"me011"::	Bell Digits.::	0
"me011"::	Alright.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"mn017"::	By the way, I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr- improve them::	1
"mn017"::	by, um,  not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation::	0
"mn017"::	on a small amount of digit data collected::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	in this setting.::	1
"mn017"::	Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f- for the far-field microphones, you know, to the noise.::	0
"mn017"::	And  that  should really improve things, um, further.::	0
"mn017"::	And then you use those  adapted  models, which are not  speaker  adapted but sort of acous- you know, channel adapted -::	0
"me011"::	Channel adapted.::	0
"mn017"::	use  that  as the starting models for your speaker adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But the thing is, uh - I mean, w- when you -::	0
"me013"::	it depends whether you're ju- were just using this as a -::	0
"me013"::	a starter task for - you know, to get things going for  conversational  or if we're really interested i- in connected digits. And I - I think the answer is  both.::	0
"mn017"::	Well, I don't know.::	0
"me013"::	And for - for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because::	0
"me013"::	somebody  gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it.::	0
"fe008"::	This is - this - that one's better. Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	You don't - don't, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	Right. Um, but, you know, I - uh, my impression was that you were actually interested in the far-field microphone,::	0
"mn017"::	uh, problem, I mean. So,::	0
"mn017"::	you want to - you want to - That's the obvious thing to  try.  Right? Then, eh - because::	0
"fe008"::	Oh. Oh.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	you - you don't have any - That's where the most m- acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the - the r- the set up here. So.::	1
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. So that'd be anoth- another interesting data point. I mean, I - I guess I'm saying I don't know if we'd want to do that as the - as -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Other way. Liz -::	0
"mn014"::	Other way.::	0
"fe016"::	Now you're all watching me.  Alright. This way.::	0
"me011"::	It f- it clips over your ears. There you go.::	0
"fe008"::	If you have a  strong  fe- if you have a  strong  preference, you  could  use this. It's just we - we think it has some spikes. So, uh, we - we didn't use that one.::	0
"fe016"::	You're all watching.  This is terrible.::	0
"fe016"::	I'll get it.::	0
"fe008"::	But you  could  if you want. I don't know.::	0
"fe008"::	And Andre- Andreas, your - your microphone's a little bit low.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. At any rate, I don't know if w-::	0
"mn017"::	It is? Uh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.  I don't know if  we  wanna use that as the -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Uh, it  pivots.::	0
"fe008"::	So if you see the picture  and then you have to scr-::	0
"me011"::	It - it - like this.::	0
"mn017"::	I- I -::	0
"mn017"::	I - I already adjusted this a number of times. I - I::	0
"me011"::	Eh. Yeah, I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like.::	0
"mn017"::	can't quite seem to -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, I think this contraption around your head is not  working so well.::	0
"me013"::	Too many adju- too many adjustments. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Anyway, what I was saying is that I - I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the  norm,  that we compared all things to.::	0
"fe008"::	That looks good. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	To, uh, the - to have - have all this ad- all this, uh, adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	But I think it's an important data point,::	1
"me013"::	if you're - if - Yeah.::	1
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	The other thing that - that, uh - of course,::	1
"me013"::	what Barry was looking at was - was just that, the near versus far. And, yeah, the adaptation would get::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	th- some of that. But, I think even - even if there was, uh, only a factor of two or something, like I was saying in the email, I think that's -::	0
"me013"::	that's a  big  factor. So -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	N-::	0
"me011"::	Liz, you could also just use the other mike if you're having problems with that one.::	0
"fe008"::	Well.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. This would be O_K. We - we - we think that this has  spikes  on it, so it's not as good acoustically, but -::	0
"fe016"::	It's this thing's - This is too big for my head.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, basically your  ears  are too big. I mean, mine are too.::	0
"fe016"::	No, my - my - But this is too big for my  head.  So, I mean,::	0
"mn017"::	E- th- everybody's ears are too big for these things.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh -::	0
"fe016"::	it doesn't - you know, it's sit-::	0
"fe008"::	Well, if you'd  rather  have this one then it's -::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Oh, well.::	0
"me013"::	It's  great.::	0
"me011"::	So the -::	0
"me011"::	To get that, uh, pivoted this way, it pivots like this.::	0
"fe016"::	No this way. Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah. There you go.::	0
"fe008"::	And there's a screw that you can tighten.::	0
"me011"::	And then it - Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Right. I already  tried to get it close.::	0
"fe008"::	Good.::	0
"me011"::	So if it doesn't bounce around too much, that's actually good placement.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	That looks good.::	0
"me011"::	But it looks like it's gonna bounce a lot.::	0
"me013"::	So, where were we? Uh -  Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Digits. Adaptation.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, adaptation, non-adaptation,::	0
"me013"::	um, factor of two,::	0
"me013"::	um -::	0
"mn017"::	What k- u- By the way, wh-  what  factor of two did you - ? I mean -::	0
"me013"::	Oh, yeah. I know what I was go- w-::	0
"me013"::	Oh, no, no. It's tha- that - that we were saying, you know, well is - how much worse is far than near, you know. And I mean it depends on which one you're looking at, but for the everybody, it's::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, th- O_K.  That  factor of two.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	little under a factor or two.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I - I know what I was thinking was that maybe, uh,::	1
"me013"::	i- i-::	0
"me013"::	we::	0
"me013"::	could  actually t- t-  try  at least  looking  at, uh, some of the - the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone, at least from the  good  one.::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	I mean,  before  I thought we'd get, you know, a hundred and fifty percent error or something, but if -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	if, uh - if we're getting::	0
"me013"::	thirty-five, forty percent or something,::	0
"fe016"::	Actually if you run,::	0
"me013"::	u- um -::	0
"fe016"::	though, on a close-talking mike over the whole meeting, during all those silences, you get, like, four hundred percent word error.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Right. I understand. But doing the same kind of limited thing -::	0
"fe016"::	Or - or some high number.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, sure. Get all these insertions. But I'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing::	1
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as - a-::	1
"fe016"::	Where you know who the speaker is and there's no overlap?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And you do just the far-field for those regions?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from. Right?::	0
"me011"::	Could we do  exactly  the same thing that we're doing now, but do it with a far-field mike?::	1
"me013"::	Yeah, do it with one of - on-::	0
"me011"::	Cuz we extract the  times  from the near-field mike, but you use the  acoustics  from the far-field mike.::	1
"fe016"::	Right. I understand that. I just meant that - so you have  three choices. There's, um -::	0
"fe016"::	You can use times::	0
"fe016"::	where that person is talking  only  from the transcripts but the segmentations were -::	0
"fe016"::	were synchronized. Or you can do a forced alignment on the  close-talking::	0
"fe016"::	to determine that, the- you know, within this segment, these really were the times that this person was talking and::	0
"fe016"::	elsewhere  in the segment other people are  overlapping  and just front-end  those  pieces.::	0
"fe016"::	Or you can run it on the whole data, which is -::	0
"me013"::	But - but - but how did we get the - how did we determine::	0
"fe016"::	which is, you know, a -::	0
"me013"::	the links,::	0
"me013"::	uh, that we're testing on::	0
"me013"::	in the stuff we reported?::	0
"fe016"::	In the H_L_ T  paper we took  segments that are channel -  time-aligned,  which is now h- being changed in the  transcription  process, which is good,::	1
"fe016"::	and we took cases where the  transcribers  said there was only one person talking here, because no one else had time -::	1
"fe016"::	any  words in that segment and called that "non-overlap".::	1
"me013"::	And tha-::	0
"me013"::	And that's what we were getting those numbers from. Right.::	1
"fe016"::	Yes.::	0
"fe016"::	Tho- good - the good numbers. The bad numbers were from  the segments where there was overlap.::	1
"me013"::	Well, we could  start  with the good ones. But anyway - so I think that we should try it once with::	1
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	the same conditions that were used to create  those,  and in those same segments just use one of the P_Z_Ms.::	1
"fe016"::	Right. So we - we can do  that.  Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And then, you know, I mean, the thing is if we were getting, uh - what, thirty-five, forty percent, something like that on - on that particular set,::	0
"me013"::	uh, does it go to seventy or eighty? Or, does it use up so much memory we can't decode it?::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	It might also depend on  which  speaker th- it is and how close they are to the P_Z_M? I don't know how different they are from each other.::	0
"me013"::	Uh -::	0
"mn017"::	You want to probably choose the P_Z_M channel that is closest to the speaker.::	1
"fe016"::	To be best -::	0
"me011"::	For this particular digit ones, I just picked that one.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	f-::	0
"me013"::	Well -::	0
"fe016"::	O_K. So we would then use that one, too, or - ?::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"me011"::	So -::	0
"me013"::	This is kind of central.::	0
"me013"::	You know, it's - so i- but I would - I'd pick that one. It'll be less good for some people than for other, but I - I'd like to see it on the same - exact same data set that - that we did the other thing on. Right?::	1
"me011"::	Actually -::	0
"me011"::	I sh- actually  should've  picked a different one, because  that  could  be why the P_D_A is worse.::	1
"me011"::	Because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.::	1
"mn014"::	It's further away. Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	That's probably  one  of the reasons.::	0
"fe008"::	Hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, yeah. You could look at, I guess,  that  P_Z_M or something.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	But the other is, it's very, uh - I mean, even though there's - I'm sure the f- f-::	0
"me013"::	the - the S_R_I, uh, front-end has some kind of pre-emphasis, it's - it's, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	still, th- it's picking up  lots  of low-frequency energy. So, even discriminating against it, I'm sure some of it's getting through.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	But, yeah, you're right. Prob- a part of it is just the distance.::	0
"fe016"::	And aren't these pretty bad microphones?::	0
"me013"::	Well, they're  bad.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean -::	0
"me013"::	But, I mean, if you listen to it, it sounds O_K. You know?::	0
"me011"::	Yeah. When you  listen  to it,::	0
"me013"::	u-  Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	uh, the P_Z_M and the P_D_A - Yeah, th- the P_D_A has higher sound floor but not by a lot. It's really pretty -::	0
"me011"::	uh, pretty much the same.::	0
"fe016"::	I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose.::	0
"fe016"::	Cheap in terms of their quality. So.::	0
"me013"::	Well, they're  twenty-five cents or so. Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Th- we wanted them to be - to be typical of what would be in a P_D_A. So they are -::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	they're not the P_Z_M three hundred dollar type. They're the twenty-five cent,::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	buy  them   in packs of thousand type.::	0
"fe016"::	I see.::	0
"me013"::	But, I mean, the thing is people use those little mikes for  everything  because they're  really  not  bad.::	0
"me011"::	Everything.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, if you're not::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	doing something  ridiculous  like feeding it to a speech recognizer, they - they -  they - you know, you can hear the sou- hear the sounds just fine.  You know, it's -::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	They - I mean, i- it's more or less the same  principles  as these other mikes are built under, it's just that  there's less quality control.::	0
"me013"::	They just, you know, churn  them   out and don't check  them.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	So that was - Yeah. So that was i- interesting result. So like I said, the front-end guys are::	0
"me013"::	very much interested in - in this is as - as well and::	0
"mn017"::	So - so, but where is this now? I mean, what's - where do we go from here? I mean,::	1
"me011"::	Yeah. That was gonna be my question.::	0
"mn017"::	we - so we have a - we have a - a system that works pretty well but it's not, you know, the system that::	0
"mn017"::	people here are  used  to using - to working with. So what - what do we do now?::	0
"me013"::	Well, I think what we wanna do is we want to - eh, and we've talked about this in other  contexts - we want to::	1
"me013"::	have the ability to feed it different features.::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm. O_K.::	0
"me013"::	And then, um,::	1
"me013"::	from the point of view of the front-end research, it would be s- uh, substituting for H_T_K.::	1
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	I think that's the key thing. And then if we can feed it different features, then we can try all the different things that we're trying there.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	Alright.::	0
"me013"::	And then, um,::	1
"me013"::	uh, also Dave is - is thinking about::	0
"me013"::	using the data in different ways, uh, to::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	um,::	0
"me013"::	uh,::	0
"me013"::	explicitly work on reverberation starting with some techniques that some other people have  found somewhat useful, and - Yeah.::	1
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	So - so the key  thing that's missing here is basically the::	1
"mn017"::	ability to feed,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, other features  i- into the recognizer and also then to train the system.::	1
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K. And, uh, es- I don't know when Chuck will be back but that's exactly what he - he's gonna -::	0
"me013"::	H- h-::	0
"me013"::	He's - he's  sort  of back, but he drove for fourteen hours an- and wasn't gonna make it in today.::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, O_K. So,::	0
"mn017"::	I think that's one of the things that he said he would be working on. Um.::	0
"mn017"::	Just sort of t- to make sure that  we can do that and -::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	It's - uh, I mean, the - the front-end is f- i- tha- that's in the S_R_I recognizer is very nice in that it::	1
"mn017"::	does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately  is not  designed and, um -  like the, uh, ICSI system is, where you can feed it::	1
"mn017"::	from a pipeline of - of the command. So,::	1
"mn017"::	the - what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that::	0
"mn017"::	you have to, uh, dump out, um -::	1
"mn017"::	you know, if you want to use some new features, you have to dump them into::	1
"mn017"::	individual files::	1
"mn017"::	and  give those files to the recognizer.::	0
"me011"::	We do - we tend to do that anyway.::	1
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Oh. So, although you - you can pipe it as well, we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re-doing it over and over.::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	Alright.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. So I've - I -::	0
"me011"::	So tha- that's exactly what the P_file  is for.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, the - the - the cumbersome thing is - is, um - is that you actually have to dump out little - little files. So for each segment that you want to recognize  you have to  dump out  a separate file.::	1
"fe016"::	Uh -::	0
"me011"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"mn017"::	Just like i- th- like th- as if there were these waveform segments, but instead you have sort of feature file segments.::	0
"mn017"::	But, you know -::	0
"mn017"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Cool.::	0
"me013"::	O_K. So the s- the - the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments?::	0
"fe016"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	Yes, we have -::	0
"fe016"::	I don't know, did  you  wanna talk about it, or - ?::	0
"fe016"::	I can give a - I was just telling this to  Jane  and - and -::	1
"fe016"::	W- we -::	0
"fe016"::	we were able to get some::	0
"fe016"::	definite improvement on the forced alignments by::	0
"fe016"::	looking  at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors  that were occurring and::	1
"fe016"::	um,::	0
"fe016"::	some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition, which is a::	0
"fe016"::	um,::	0
"fe016"::	I think was  both  a - a pruning  problem  and::	0
"fe016"::	possibly a::	0
"fe016"::	problem with::	0
"fe016"::	needing constraints on word locations. And so we tried both of these  st-  things. We tried saying -::	0
"fe016"::	I don't know, I got this  whacky idea that -::	0
"fe016"::	just from looking at the data, that when people talk  their words are usually chunked together.::	0
"fe016"::	It's not that they say one word::	0
"fe016"::	and then there's a bunch of words together.::	0
"fe016"::	They're   might  say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels?::	0
"fe016"::	But in general, if there's, like, five or six words and one word's far  away  from it, that's probably  wrong  on average. So,::	0
"fe016"::	um -::	0
"fe016"::	And then also, ca- the pruning, of course, was too - too severe.::	0
"mn017"::	So that's actually interesting. The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition.::	0
"mn017"::	And we had lowered that - we had used  tighter  pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, it runs  slower  and there's no real difference in -::	0
"me011"::	No gain.::	0
"fe016"::	Actually it was  better  with - slightly better or about th- it was the  same  with tighter pruning.::	1
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	So for free recognition, this - the lower pruning value is  better.  You -::	1
"fe016"::	It's probably cuz the recognition's just bad en-::	0
"fe016"::	at a point where it's  bad  enough that - that you don't lose anything.::	0
"mn017"::	Correct.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Um, but it turned out for - for - to get accurate  alignments  it was really important to open up the pruning::	1
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	significantly.::	1
"me013"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Um  because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment, um, in regions where there was no real speech  yet  from the foreground speaker.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Um,  so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that,::	1
"mn017"::	you know, as Liz said the - we f- enforce::	1
"mn017"::	the fact that,::	0
"mn017"::	uh, the foreground speech has to be continuous. It cannot be -::	1
"mn017"::	you cannot have a background speech::	0
"mn017"::	hypothesis in the  middle  of the foreground speech. You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. I mean, yeah, it isn't  always  true, and I think what we really want is some  clever  way to do this, where,::	1
"fe016"::	um, you know, from the  data  or from maybe some hand-corrected alignments from transcribers that::	1
"fe016"::	things like::	1
"fe016"::	words that  do  occur just by themselves  a- alone, like backchannels or something that we  did  allow to have background speech around it -::	1
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	those  would be able to do that, but the rest would be constrained.::	1
"fe008"::	Sorry.::	0
"fe016"::	So, I think we have a version that's::	1
"fe016"::	pretty good for the native speakers. I don't know yet about the non-native speakers.::	1
"fe016"::	And, um,::	0
"fe016"::	we basically also made noise models for the different - sort of grouped some of the  mouth noises together.::	0
"fe016"::	Um, so, and then there's a background speech model.::	1
"fe016"::	And we also -::	0
"fe016"::	There was some neat - or, interesting cases, like there's one meeting where,::	0
"fe016"::	um, Jose's giving a presentation and he's talking about,::	0
"fe016"::	um, the word "mixed  signal" and someone didn't understand,::	0
"fe016"::	uh, that you were saying " mixed " -::	0
"fe016"::	I think, Morgan.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And so your speech -ch::	0
"fe016"::	was s- saying something about mixed signal. And the next turn::	0
"fe016"::	was::	0
"fe016"::	a  lot  of people saying "mixed", like "he means mixed signal" or "I think it's mixed". And the word "mixed" in this  segment  occurs, like, a bunch of times.::	0
"mn005"::	Sh-::	0
"fe016"::	And Chuck's on the  lapel  here, and he also says "mixed" but it's at the  last  one, and of course the aligner th- aligns it  everywhere  else to  everybody  else's "mixed",::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	cuz there's no adaptation yet. So there's -::	0
"fe016"::	I think there's some issues about -::	0
"fe016"::	u-::	1
"fe016"::	We probably want to adapt::	0
"fe016"::	at least the foreground speaker. But, I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker, and that's actually a little bit::	1
"fe016"::	of a f- funky model. Like, it gives you some weird alignments, just because often the  background  speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker. So there's some things  there,  especially when you get lots of the same words,::	1
"mn017"::	Oh -::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	uh, occurring in the -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, the -::	0
"mn017"::	I - I think you can do better by::	0
"mn017"::	uh, cloning - so we have a reject phone.::	0
"mn017"::	And you - and what we wanted to try with - you know, once we have this paper written and have a little more time,::	1
"mn017"::	uh, t- cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker::	1
"mn017"::	to capture the rejects in the  foreground,  like fragments and stuff, and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker.::	1
"fe016"::	Right. I mean, in general we actually -::	0
"mn017"::	And -::	0
"fe016"::	Right now the words like  partial words are  reject models::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	and you normally allow those to match to any word. But then the background speech was also a reject model,::	0
"fe016"::	and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between - you know, it needs to differentiate between the two. So just sort of working through a bunch of::	1
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	debugging kinds of issues.::	1
"fe016"::	And  another  one is turns, like people starting with::	0
"fe016"::	"well I think" and someone else is  "well how about". So the word "well" is in this -::	0
"fe016"::	in this  segment::	0
"fe016"::	multiple times, and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it.::	0
"fe016"::	But then that::	0
"fe016"::	constraint of sort of -::	0
"fe016"::	uh,  proximity  constraint will push it over to the person who  really  said it in general.::	0
"me011"::	Is the proximity constraint a  hard  constraint, or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance, or - ?::	0
"mn017"::	We - we didn't - No. We - w-::	0
"fe016"::	Right now it's a kluge.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K. We - it's straightforward to actually just have a - a penalty that doesn't::	0
"mn017"::	completely disallows it but discourages it.::	0
"mn017"::	But, um, we just didn't have time to play with, you know, tuning yet another - yet another parameter.::	0
"me011"::	The ve- level. Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a - we don't have ground truth for these. So,::	1
"mn017"::	we would need a hand-marked, um,  word-level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw- you know, between the speakers.::	1
"mn017"::	Um,::	0
"mn017"::	and then use that as a reference and tune::	1
"mn017"::	the parameters of the - of the model, uh, to op- to get the best  performance.::	1
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	G- given - I - I mean, I wa- I wa- I was gonna ask you anyway, uh, how you assessed that things were better.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	I looked at them. I spent  two   days  - um, in  Waves  -::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	Oh, it was  painful  because::	0
"fe016"::	the thing is, you know the alignments share a lot in common, so -::	0
"fe016"::	And you're - yo- you're looking at these segments where there's a  lot  of speech. I mean, a lot of them have a lot of words.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Not by  every  speaker but by  some  speaker there's a lot of words.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Ju-::	0
"fe016"::	No, not - I mean that if you look at the individual::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	segments from just one  person  you don't see a lot of words, but  altogether  you'll see a lot of words up there. And so the  reject  is also mapping and  pauses  -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So I looked at  them   all in Waves and just lined up all the alignments,::	0
"fe016"::	and, at first it sort of looked like a  mess  and then the more I looked at it, I thought "O_K, well it's moving these words leftward and -"::	0
"fe016"::	You know, it wasn't  that  bad. It was just doing certain things wrong. So - But, I don't,::	0
"fe016"::	you know, have  time  to l-  to look at all of them and it would be  really  useful to have, like, a - a transcriber who could use Waves,::	1
"fe016"::	um, just mark, like, the beginning and end::	0
"fe016"::	of the foreground speaker's  real   words  - like, the beginning of the first word, the end of the last word - and then we could,::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	I - O_K. I have to ask you something, which is, first of all, um,::	0
"fe016"::	you know, do some adjustments.::	0
"fe008"::	is i- does it  have  to be  Waves?  Because if we could benefit from what  you  did, incorporate that into the present transcripts,  that would help.::	0
"mn017"::	No.::	0
"fe008"::	And then, um, the  other  thing is, I believe that I  did  hand-::	0
"fe008"::	So. One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand-marked it myself so that we  do  have, uh, the beginning and ending of individual  utterances.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Um, I didn't do it  word  level, but - but in terms - So I - so for - for one of the N_S_ A  groups. And  also  I went back to the original one that I  first  transcribed and - and did it::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	w- uh, w- uh, utterance by utterance for  that  particular one. So I think you  do  have -::	0
"fe008"::	if that's a sufficient unit, I think that you  do  have hand-marking for  that.  But it'd be wonderful to be able to::	0
"fe008"::	benefit from your Waves stuff.::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	We don't care what - what tool you use.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K. I used it in Transcriber and it's - it's in the -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. I mean, if - if you can, um - if you wanna - well, Jane and I were -::	0
"mn017"::	U- uh -::	0
"fe016"::	just in terms of the  tool,  talking about this. I guess  Sue  had had some  reactions. You know, interface-wise if you're looking at speech, you wanna be able to know really where the words are. And so,::	1
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's right. Middle of the word, or -::	0
"fe016"::	we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like, um, and see if you can in-::	1
"fe016"::	maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way,  or -::	1
"fe008"::	Well, I th- I'm thinking just ch- e- e- incorporating it into the  representation.  I mean, if it's - if it's -::	0
"fe016"::	Um.::	0
"fe016"::	You mean like -  Yeah,  word start insights.::	0
"fe008"::	if you have start points, if you have, like,  time  tags, which is what I  assume.  Isn't that what - what you - ? Well, see, Adam would be -::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, whatever you use. I mean, we convert it to this format::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	that the, um, NIST scoring tool::	0
"mn017"::	unders- uh, C_T_M.::	0
"mn017"::	Conversation Time-Marked file. And - and then that's the - that's what the -::	0
"me011"::	I think Transcriber, uh, outputs C_T_M.::	0
"fe008"::	If it - ? O_K. So you would know this more than I would.::	0
"me011"::	I  think  so.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.  So, I mean -::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	It  seems  like she - if she's g- if she's moving  time  marks around, since our representation in Transcriber uses  time  marks, it seems like there should be  some  way of - of  using  that -  benefitting  from that.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, it wou- the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you  would  be able - if you were zoomed in  enough::	1
"fe016"::	in Transcriber to see all the words, you would be able to, like, have the words sort of located in time,::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	if you wanted to do that. So.::	0
"me013"::	So - so if we e- e- even just had a - a - It sounds like w- we -::	0
"me013"::	we almost  do.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, if we - We have two. Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	We have two.::	0
"me013"::	Just ha- uh,::	0
"me013"::	trying out  the alignment::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	procedure that you have on  that  you could actually get something, um - uh, uh, get an objective measure.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Uh -::	0
"fe016"::	You mean on - on the hand-marked, um -::	0
"fe016"::	So we - we only r- hav- I only  looked  at actually alignments from  one  meeting that we chose, I think M_R four, just randomly, um -::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And -::	0
"mn017"::	Actually,  not  randomly. We knew - we knew that it had these insertion errors from - Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Not randomly -::	0
"fe016"::	It had sort of  average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers and::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	it was a Meeting Recorder meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	Um. But, yeah, we should try to  use  what you have. I  did  re-run recognition on your new version of::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, good. Good!::	0
"fe016"::	M_R  one.  I - I mean the - the one with Dan  Ellis in it  and Eric.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	I don't think that was the  new  version.::	0
"fe016"::	Um -::	0
"fe016"::	That - Yeah, actually it wasn't the new new, it was the medium new. But - but we would - we should do the - the  latest  version. It was the one from last week.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me001"::	Yeah. You - did you adjust the - the utterance times, um, for each channel?::	0
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"fe008"::	Yes, I did. And  furthermore,  I found that there were a certain number where -::	0
"fe008"::	not - not a  lot,  but several times I actually   moved  an utterance from  Adam's channel to  Dan's  or from  Dan's  to  Adam's.  So there was some speaker identif-::	0
"fe008"::	And the  reason  was because  I transcribed that at a point before -::	0
"fe008"::	uh, before we had the multiple  audio  available f-::	0
"fe008"::	so I couldn't  switch  between the  audio.   I - I transcribed it off of the mixed channel  entirely,  which meant in overlaps, I was at a - at a terrific disadvantage.::	0
"fe016"::	Right. Right.::	0
"fe008"::	In  addition  it was before the  channelized,  uh, possibility was there. And  finally  I did it using the speakers of my, um -::	0
"fe008"::	of - you know, off the C_P_U on my - on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone.::	0
"fe008"::	So it  @@ , like, I mean -::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, I - I mean, i- in retrospect  it would've been good to ha-::	0
"fe008"::	have got- I should've gotten a headphone.::	0
"fe008"::	But in  any  case, um, thi- this is - this was transcribed in a - in a,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, less optimal way than - than the ones that came after it, and I was able to - you know, an- and  this  meant that there were some speaker identif- identifications which were::	0
"me001"::	Well, I know there were some speaker labeling problems, um, after interruptions. Is that what you're referring to?::	1
"fe008"::	changes. Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Fixed that.::	1
"fe008"::	Oh, well -::	0
"me001"::	I mean, cuz there's this one instance when, for example, you're running down the stairs. I remember this meeting really well.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Don - Don has had -  He knows - he can just read it like a play.::	0
"me001"::	Right.  It's a  -::	0
"me001"::	Yeah, I've - I've - I'm very well acquainted with this meeting.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	Yeah, I can s-::	0
"fe016"::	"And then  she  said, and then  he  said."::	0
"me001"::	Yeah, I know it by heart. So, um,  there's one point when you're running down the stairs. Right? And, like, there's an interruption.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-oh.::	0
"me001"::	You interrupt somebody, but then there's no line after that. For example, there's no speaker identification after that line.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me001"::	Is that what you're talking about? Or were there mislabelings as far as, like, the a- Adam was - ?::	0
"fe008"::	That was fixed, um, before -::	0
"fe008"::	i- i- i- I think I- I think I understood that pretty - Thank you for mentioning. Yeah, no, tha- that -::	0
"me001"::	Yeah. Cuz I thought I let you know about that. Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	That I think went away a couple of versions ago, but it's good to know.::	0
"me001"::	O_K. But you're actually saying that certain, uh, speakers were mis- mis-identified.::	1
"fe008"::	Yeah.  So, with - under - um, uh, listening to the mixed channel, there were times when, as surprising as that is,::	0
"fe008"::	I got Adam's voice confused with Dan's and vice versa - not for  long  utterances, but jus- just a couple of places,::	0
"me001"::	O_K.::	0
"me001"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	and embedde- embedded in overlaps. The  other  thing that was w- interesting to me was::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	that I picked up a lot of, um,  backchannels  which were hidden in the mixed signal, which, you know, I mean, you c- not - not too surprising.::	1
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	But the  other  thing that -::	0
"fe008"::	I - I  hadn't  thought about this, but I thou- I wanted to raise this when you were -::	0
"fe008"::	uh, with respect to also a  strategy  which might help with the alignments  potentially,  but that's -::	0
"fe008"::	When I was looking at these backchannels,::	1
"fe008"::	they were turning up usually -::	0
"fe008"::	very  often in - w- well, I won't say "usually" - but anyway, very often, I picked them up in a channel::	0
"fe008"::	w- which was the person who had asked a question.  S- so, like, someone says "an- and have you done the so-and-so?"::	1
"fe008"::	And then there would be  backchannels,  but it would be the person who asked the  question.  Other people weren't really  doing  much backchanneling.::	0
"fe008"::	And, you know, sometimes you have the - Yeah, uh-huh.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, that's interesting.::	0
"fe008"::	I mean, i- it wouldn't be  perfect,  but - but it  does  seem more natural to give a backchannel when -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	No, that's really interesting.::	0
"fe008"::	when you're somehow involved in the  topic,  and the most natural way is for you to have  initiated  the topic by asking a question.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Well,::	0
"fe016"::	That's interesting.::	0
"mn017"::	I think - No. I think it's - actually I think what's going on is  backchanneling  is something that happens in two-party conversations. And if you ask someone a question, you essentially initiating a little two-party conversation.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, actu- Yeah, when we  looked  at this -::	0
"mn017"::	So then you're - so and then you're expected to backchannel because the person is addressing  you  directly and not everybody.::	0
"fe008"::	Exactly.::	0
"fe008"::	Exactly.::	0
"fe008"::	Exactly my point. An- and so this is the expectation thing that - uh, uh, just the dyadic - But in  addition,::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah. Yeah. Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	H-::	0
"fe008"::	you know, if someone has  done  this analysis  himself  and  isn't  involved in the  dyad,::	0
"fe008"::	but they might also give backchannels to verify what - what the answer is that this - that the - the  answerer's  given -::	0
"me013"::	I tell you, I say - I say "uh-huh" a  lot,::	0
"fe016"::	Right. It's -::	0
"fe008"::	There you go.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, but it's interesting cuz, uh -::	0
"me013"::	while people are talking to each other.::	0
"fe008"::	There  you go. Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	But there are  fewer  - I think there are fewer "uh-huhs". I mean, just from - We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would  allow  to have the  reject  words in  between  in doing the  alignment.::	1
"fe016"::	You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And::	0
"fe016"::	"uh-huh" is not as frequent::	0
"fe016"::	as it sort of would be in Switchboard, if you looked at just a word frequency list of one-word::	1
"fe016"::	short utterances. And " yeah " is way up there, but not "uh-huh". And so I was thinking::	1
"fe016"::	thi- it's not like  you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep  talking in the meeting. And uh, that's all, I- I'll stop there, cuz I- I think what you say makes a lot of sense.  But it was sort of -::	0
"fe008"::	Well, that's right. And that would -::	0
"fe008"::	Well, an-::	0
"fe008"::	And what you say is the - is the re- uh, o-  other  side of this, which is that, you know, so::	0
"fe008"::	th- there are lots of channels where you  don't  have these backchannels, w- when a question has been asked and - and these -::	0
"fe016"::	Right. There's just probably less backchanneling::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	So that's good news, really.::	0
"fe016"::	in  general,  even if you consider  every  other person altogether one person::	0
"fe016"::	in the meeting, but we'll find out anyway. We were - I guess the other thing we're - we're - I should say is that we're gonna, um::	1
"fe016"::	try - compare this type of  overlap  analysis to  Switchboard,::	1
"mn017"::	And CallHome.::	0
"fe016"::	where - and  CallHome,  where we  have  both sides, so that we can try to answer this question of, you know,::	1
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	is there really  more   overlap  in  meetings  or is it just because we don't have the other channel in  Switchboard  and we don't know what people are doing.::	1
"fe016"::	Try to create a paper out of that.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I mean, y- y- you folks have probably  already told me, but were - were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission, or - ?::	1
"fe016"::	Um, you mean the one due  tomorrow?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. Well, we're still, like, writing the scripts::	0
"fe016"::	for doing the research, and we will - Yes, we're gonna try.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	And I was telling Don, do not  take this as an example of how people should work.::	0
"me013"::	Do as I say, don't do as I do. Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	That's r-::	0
"fe016"::	So,::	0
"fe016"::	we will  try.  It'll probably be a little late, but I'm gonna try it.::	0
"me011"::	Well -::	0
"me011"::	It  is  different. In previous years, Eurospeech only had the  abstract  due by now, not the full paper.::	0
"me001"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	And so all our timing was off. I've given up on trying to do digits. I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, I'm no- We may be in the same position, and I figured::	1
"fe016"::	we'll  try,  because that'll at least get us to the point where we have - We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that -::	1
"fe016"::	It - it's not very  fancy.  It's just a::	1
"fe016"::	ASCII line by line format, but it  does  give you information -::	1
"mn017"::	It's the - it's the spurt format.::	1
"fe016"::	It - Yeah, we're calling these "spurts" after Chafe. I was trying to find what's a word for  a continuous region with  pauses around it?::	1
"fe008"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I know that th- the Telecom people use - use "spurt" for that. Yes.::	0
"fe008"::	Good.::	0
"fe016"::	They do? Oh! Oh. I would jus-::	0
"mn017"::	Oh.::	0

"fe016"::	Ah, right!::	0
"fe016"::	It's just, like, defined by the  acoustics.::	0
"me013"::	in which - and - an- because - cuz it's  another  question about how  many pauses they put in  between  them. But how fast do they::	0
"me011"::	Horrible.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	do  the words within the spurt? Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	you know  " Burst " also? Isn't "burst" is used also?::	0
"fe016"::	Right. Well, that's what we were calling::	0
"me011"::	It's gonna - Burst.::	0
"fe016"::	spurt, so -::	0
"me011"::	Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other - with hardware at ICSI.::	0
"mn005"::	Here  @@  -::	0
"me013"::	Here.  Just very locally, yeah. But - but that just -::	0
"fe016"::	Well, well,  Chafe  had this wor- I think it was Chafe, or somebody had a - the word "spurt" originally, and so I -::	0
"fe008"::	Actually -::	0
"fe016"::	But tha- that's good to know. Was thi- it's Chafe?::	0
"fe008"::	Well, see, I know S- Sue wrote about spurts of development.  But,  in any case, I think it's a good term, and, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	So maybe we should talk -::	0
"fe016"::	Maybe it was Sue - ? Y-::	0
"me011"::	Hmm!::	0
"fe016"::	So we have spurts and we have spurt-ify dot shell and spurt-ify::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	And ma- maybe - maybe Chafe did. I know - I know Ch- Chafe dealt with -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh. So s-::	0
"me001"::	That's cool.::	0
"fe016"::	And then it's got all - it's a verb now.::	0
"mn017"::	W- uh, w-::	0
"fe008"::	Chafe speaks about  intonation  units.::	0
"fe016"::	Yes. Right.::	0
"fe008"::	But maybe he  speaks  about spurts as well and I just don't know. Yeah, go ahead.::	0
"mn017"::	We-::	0
"mn017"::	So what we're doing - uh, this - this is just - maybe someone has s- some - some ideas about how to do it better, but we -::	0
"me011"::	I've heard "burst" also.::	0
"me001"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn017"::	So we're taking these, uh, alignments from the individual channels.::	0
"mn017"::	We're -::	0
"mn017"::	from each alignment we're producing, uh, one of these C_T_M files, which essentially has - it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration.::	1
"fe008"::	Great.::	0
"mn017"::	And - and - and of course -::	0
"fe016"::	It looks like a Waves label file almost. Right? It's just -::	0
"mn017"::	Right. But it has - one - the first column has the meeting  name,  so it could actually contain several meetings. Um.::	0
"mn017"::	And the second column is the channel.::	1
"mn017"::	Third column is the, um,  start  times of the words and the fourth column is the  duration  of the words.::	1
"mn017"::	And then we're,::	0
"mn017"::	um -::	0
"mn017"::	O_K. Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words::	1
"mn017"::	the, uh,  tags  for, like, where - where sentence - ends of sentence, question marks, um,::	1
"mn017"::	various other things. Uh.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. These are things that we had Don - So, Don sort of,::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	um, propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber - so whether it was, like, question mark or period or,::	0
"fe016"::	um, you know, comma and things like that, and we kept the - and disfluency dashes -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	uh, kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the::	0
"fe016"::	spurt overlaps - sp- overlaps, or -::	0
"mn017"::	Right. So - so those are actually sort of retro-fitted into the time alignment.::	0
"mn017"::	And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time.::	1
"mn017"::	And then::	0
"mn017"::	there's a -::	0
"mn017"::	then there's a process where you now determine the spurts.::	0
"mn017"::	That is -::	0
"mn017"::	Actually, no, you do that before you merge the various channels. So you - you id- identify by some criterion, which is pause length -::	0
"mn017"::	you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts, and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	And then you  merge  everything in terms of, you know, linearizing the sequence based on the  time  marks.::	0
"mn017"::	And  then::	0
"mn017"::	you extract::	0
"mn017"::	the individual channels again, but this time you  know  where the other people start and end talking -::	0
"mn017"::	you know, where their spurts start and end.::	0
"mn017"::	And so you extract the individual  channels,  uh, one sp- spurt by spurt as it were.::	1
"mn017"::	Um, and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end  tags for overlaps. So,::	1
"mn017"::	you - you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers' speech.::	1
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Uh, I mean, I think that's actually really u- useful  also  because::	1
"mn017"::	And -::	0
"fe016"::	even if you weren't studying overlaps, if you wanna get a transcription for the far-field mikes, how are you gonna  know::	0
"fe016"::	which words from which speakers occurred at which times  relative  to each other? You  have  to be able to  get a transcript like - like this anyway, just for doing far-field recognition. So,::	1
"fe016"::	you know,::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	it's - it's sort of -::	0
"fe016"::	I thi- it's just an issue we haven't  dealt  with before, how you  time-align  things that are overlapping anyway.::	0
"fe008"::	That's wonderful.::	0
"mn017"::	So -::	0
"me011"::	Well -::	0
"mn017"::	And - and we -::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, i- I never thought about it before, but -::	0
"me011"::	Y- yes. I mean, s- when I came up with the original data - suggested data format based on the transcription graph, there's capability of doing::	0
"mn017"::	In -::	0
"me011"::	that  sort of thing  in  there.::	0
"fe016"::	Right. But you  can't  get it directly from the  transcription.  Yeah, this is like a poor man's ver-  formatting  version. But it's, you know - It's  clean,  it's just not  fancy.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right.::	0
"mn017"::	Right. Well, this is - this is just -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, there's lots of little things. It's like there're twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want. But, um,::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Um.::	0
"mn017"::	at the very last stage we throw away the actual  time  information. All we care about is whether -::	1
"mn017"::	that there's a certain word was overlapped by someone  else's  word.::	1
"mn017"::	So you sort of - at that point, you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.::	1
"mn017"::	Because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper.::	1
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	1
"mn017"::	But if you wanted to do a more  fine-grained  analysis and say, you know, how  far  into the word is the overlap, you could do that. It's just - it'll just require more -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. Just  sort of huge.::	0
"mn017"::	you know, slightly different -::	0
"fe008"::	What's interesting is it's exactly what, um, i- in discussing with, um,  Sue  about this, um, she, um,::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	i- i- i- indicated that that -::	0
"fe008"::	you know, that's very important for overlap analysis.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. It's - it's nice to know, and also I think as a human, like, I don't always  hear  these in the actual order that they occur. So I can have two foreground speakers, you know, Morgan an- and::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	um, Adam and Jane could all be talking, and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time, and then look where they are  relative  to each other, and that's not really what I  heard.::	0
"fe008"::	And that's  another  thing she said. This is - This is Bever's - Bever's effect, when - where -::	0
"fe016"::	Cuz it's just  hard  to  do.::	0
"fe016"::	Y- Yeah. It's sort of -::	0
"fe008"::	In psy- ps- psycho-linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a- as to what they hear, that - that -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, you sort of move things around until you get to a  low information point and yo- then you can bring in the other person. So it's::	0
"fe008"::	Not the best -::	0
"fe016"::	actually not even  possible,  I think, for any  person  to listen to a mixed signal, even equalize, and make sure that they have all the words in the right order.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	So, I guess, we'll  try  to write this Eurospeech paper. I mean, we will  write  it. Whether they accept it  late or not, I don't know.::	0
"fe008"::	Superb.::	0
"fe016"::	Um, and the  good  thing is that we have - It's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic::	0

"me013"::	But, one of the reasons I have Chuck's messing around with - with the back-end that you're not supposed to touch -::	0
"me011"::	they had something specific.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, for the evaluations, yes, we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	But, uh, one of the reasons I  have  him messing around with that, because I think it's sort of an open question that we  don't  know the answer to. People always say very glibly::	0
"me013"::	that i- if you s- show improvement on a bad system, that doesn't  mean  anything, cuz it may not be -::	1
"me013"::	show - uh, because, you know, it doesn't  tell  you anything about the  good  system.::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And I -  I've  always sort of felt that that  depends.::	0
"me013"::	You know, that if some peopl- If you're actually are getting at something that has some  conceptual  substance  to it, it  will  port.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And in fact,  most  methods that people now use  were  originally tried with something that was not their absolute  best system at  some  level.::	0
"me013"::	But of course, sometimes it doesn't,::	0
"me013"::	uh, port. So I think that's - that's an interesting question. If we're getting  three percent error on, uh,::	0
"me013"::	u- uh, English, uh, nati- native speakers,::	0
"me013"::	um, using the Aurora system, and we do some  improvements  and bring it from three to  two,::	0

"me013"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um,  let's see. I think the only thing we had left was - unless somebody else - Well,::	0
"me013"::	there's a  couple  things. Uh, one is  anything that, um,::	0
"me013"::	anybody has to say about Saturday? Anything we should do in prep for Saturday?::	0
"me013"::	Um -::	0
"me013"::	I guess everybody knows about -::	0
"me013"::	I mean, u- um, Mari was asking - was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we're sort of fitting around people's times a bit.::	0
"me013"::	But, um,::	0
"me013"::	clearly when we actually get here we'll  move things around this, as we need to, but -::	0
"me013"::	so you can't  absolutely  count on it. But - but, uh -::	0
"mn014"::	O_K.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Are we meeting in  here   probably  or - ? O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	That was my thought. I think this is -::	0

"me013"::	there's gonna be, uh, Jeff, Katrin, Mari and two students. So there's five  from there.::	0
"me011"::	And Brian.::	0

"fe016"::	Depends how fast you can  throw it. It's just -::	0

"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Well -::	0
"fe016"::	We don't even have enough  channel  -::	0

"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Well -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	But -::	0
"me013"::	I hadn't  really thought of it, but -::	0
"mn017"::	Maybe just - maybe not the whole day but just, you know, maybe some - I mean, part of it?::	0
"me013"::	Maybe  part  of it.::	0
"me013"::	Maybe  part  of it.::	0
"me011"::	Make everyone read digits.::	0

"me013"::	O_K. Well -::	0
"fe016"::	So can you send out a schedule once you know it, jus- ?::	0
"me013"::	O_K. Yeah. I guess I sent it around a little bit. But -::	0
"fe016"::	Is - is there a r- ? There's a res-::	0
"fe016"::	Is it  changed  now, or - ?::	0
"me013"::	I hadn't heard back from Mari after I - I u- u-::	0
"me013"::	uh, brought up the point abou- about Andreas's schedule. So,::	0
"me013"::	um, maybe when I get back there'll be  some - some mail from her.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	I'm looking forward to seeing your representation. That'd be, uh -::	0
"me013"::	So, I'll make a -::	0
"fe016"::	And w- we should get  the two meetings from y- I mean, I know about the first meeting, um,::	0
"fe008"::	I'd like to see that. Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	but the other one that you did, the N_S_A one, which we  hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it, because the non-native speaker -::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	there were  five  non-native speakers.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm. I see. Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	But, it would be useful for the -::	0
"fe016"::	to  see  what we get  with that one. So.::	0
"me001"::	Which N_S_A meeting was that?::	0
"fe008"::	Great. O_K. It's, uh, two thousand eleven twenty-one one thousand.::	0
"me001"::	Oh, we did - That was the  last  one I gave you.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah,  three.  Right. So -::	0
"me001"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Great. I sent email when I finished the -::	0
"fe008"::	that one. That was sort of son-::	0
"fe016"::	N_S_ A  three, I think.::	0
"me001"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's much simpler.::	0
"fe016"::	I don't know what they said but I know the number.::	0
"me013"::	Th- that part's  definitely  gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later. I mean, this is - we- we're recording secret N_S_A meetings? I mean, it's -::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me001"::	I remember the  date.  So.::	0
"mn017"::	Um.  Not the -  Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh. The - th- the -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. Not  that  N_S_A.::	0
"me013"::	It's network services and applications.::	0
"fe016"::	They  are  hard to understand.  They're very, uh, out there. I have no idea what they're talking about.::	0
"mn017"::	Wait.  The -::	0
"me001"::	Yeah, they're cryptic.::	0
"mn017"::	The, um -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	th- the  other  good thing about the alignments is that, um, it's not always the  machine's  fault if it doesn't work.  So, you can actually find, um,::	1
"fe016"::	It's the person's fault.  It's Morgan's fault.::	0
"mn017"::	problem - uh, proble-  You can find -::	0
"mn017"::	You can find, uh, problems with - with the transcripts, um, you know,::	1
"me013"::	It's always Morgan's fault.::	0
"me011"::	Oh.::	0
"mn017"::	and go back and fix them. But -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Tha- There are some cases like where the - the wrong speaker - uh, these ca-::	1
"fe016"::	Not  a  lot,  but where the - the wrong person - the - the speech is addre- attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it.::	1
"fe016"::	Or at least you can get  clues to it. So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals, like what you have.::	0
"fe008"::	Interesting.::	0
"fe008"::	I guess it  does  w-::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	It  also  raises the possibility of, um, using  that  kind of representation - I mean, I don't know, this'd be something we'd wanna check,::	0
"fe008"::	but maybe using that representation for data  entry  and then  displaying  it on the channelized, uh, representation, cuz it - I think that the -::	0
"fe008"::	I mean, my - my  preference  in terms of, like,  looking  at the data is to see it  in this kind of musical score format.::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	And  also,  s- you know,  Sue's  preference as  well.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, if you can get it to -::	0
"fe008"::	And - and -  but,  I mean, this - if this is a better interface for making these kinds of,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, you know, lo- clos- local changes, then that'd be fine, too. I don't - I have no idea. I think this is something that would need to be  checked.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.   Th- the  other  thing  I  had actually was, I - I didn't  realize  this till  today,   but, uh, this is, uh, Jose's last  day.::	0

"me013"::	W- wait - wait a minute - wait a minute.::	0
"me013"::	W- we want - we want -::	0
"me013"::	we want it  synchronized.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Hey,  you've  done this before. Haven't you?::	0

"me013"::	We-::	0
"me013"::	Y-  Yeah, bu-::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, and the  groupings  are important, so yo- you're supposed to pause between the groupings.::	0
"mn005"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn005"::	The grouping.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. O_K. So, uh -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0

"me001"::	Oh,  wow.::	0
"mn017"::	No?::	0
"fe016"::	That'd be good. We- we'll give everybody the same sheet but they say different -::	0
"mn017"::	It's like a - like a Greek - like a Greek choir? You know? Like -  Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Hey, what a good idea. We could do the same sheet for everyone. Have  them   all read  them   at once.::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, different digits but same groupings.::	0
"mn014"::	Eh -::	0
"me011"::	Or - or just same digits. See if anyone notices.::	0
"fe016"::	So they would all be - Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. That'd be good. And then - then we can  sing  them next time.::	0
