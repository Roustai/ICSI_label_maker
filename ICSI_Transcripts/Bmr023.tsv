"me013"::	Have we started already?::	0
"fe016"::	Well, we started recording, but - Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Is Jane around or - ?::	0
"me018"::	I  saw  her  earlier.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"fe016"::	She can just walk in, I guess,  or  -::	0
"me018"::	I think -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. She'll probably come up.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Since we're starting late I figured we'd better just start.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Great idea.  I was  gonna  ask Adam to,::	0
"me013"::	uh,::	0
"me013"::	say if he thought anymore about the  demo  stuff because::	0
"me013"::	it occurred to me that this is late May and::	0
"me013"::	the DARPA meeting is in  mid July.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, but::	0
"me013"::	I don't remember w- what we -::	0
"me013"::	I  know  that we were gonna do something with::	1
"me013"::	the transcriber interface is  one  thing, but I thought there was a  second  thing.::	1
"me013"::	Anybody remember?::	0
"fe016"::	Well,::	0
"fe016"::	we were gonna do a mock-up, like,  question  answering or something, I thought,::	0
"fe016"::	that was totally separate from the interface.  Do you remember?::	0
"fe016"::	Remember, like,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	asking questions and retrieving,::	0
"fe016"::	but in a pre-stored fashion.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	That was the thing we talked about, I think,  before  the transcriber - Come on in.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Alright. So anyway, you have to sort out that out and::	0
"me013"::	get somebody going on it cuz we're -::	0
"me013"::	got a - got a month left basically. So.::	0
"fe016"::	You  like  these. Right?::	0
"fe016"::	O_K, good.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Um::	0
"me013"::	O_K. So, what are we g-  else  we got?::	0
"me013"::	You got - you just  wrote  a bunch of stuff.::	0
"fe016"::	No. That was all, um, previously here.::	0
"me013"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	I  was  writing  the digits and then I realized I could  xerox  them,::	0
"me013"::	Oh,  oh.::	0
"fe016"::	because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones. So.::	0
"me013"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	We all, by the  way,  have the same digit form, for the record.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	That's  cool.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So, the choice is, uh, which - which do we want more, the - the - the comparison, uh,::	0
"me013"::	of everybody saying  them   at the same  time  or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that - ?::	0
"fe016"::	It's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets.::	0
"me013"::	I  know  that.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	But, you know, which opportunity should we  exploit?::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Unison.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, it - Actually it might be good to::	0
"me013"::	Unison.::	0
"fe016"::	have them separately and have the same exact strings.  I mean,::	0
"fe016"::	we could use  them   for normalizing or something,  but::	0
"fe016"::	it of course goes more quickly doing  them   in unison.  I don't know.::	0
"me013"::	I guess we'll see i- I guess it's dependent on::	0
"fe016"::	See how long we go.::	0
"me013"::	how long we go and how good the snack is out there. Yeah. Hmm. Get some advance intelligence.::	0
"mn014"::	But anyway, they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some - sometimes, you know, saying O_, and so, it's not i- not identical.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. We'd have to  train.::	0
"fe016"::	We'd be like a chorus.::	0
"mn014"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. We'd have to get s- get some experience.::	0
"mn017"::	Greek chorus.::	0
"me001"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Really   boring  chorus.::	0
"me013"::	Um. Do we  have an agenda?::	0
"me013"::	Adam usually tries to put those together, but he's ill. So.::	0
"me018"::	I've got a couple of things to talk about.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh ju- what - what might those be?::	0
"me018"::	Uh, I_B_M stuff and, um, just getting::	0
"me018"::	uh, meeting information organized.::	0
"me013"::	Meeting info organized.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"mn017"::	Are you implying that it's currently  disorganized?::	0
"me018"::	In  my  mind.::	0
"me013"::	Is there stuff that's happened about, um,::	1
"me013"::	uh,::	0
"me013"::	the  S_R_I recognizer::	0
"me013"::	et cetera, tho- those things that were happening before with - ?::	1
"me013"::	Y- y- you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front-ends and then with -::	1
"mn017"::	Well.::	0
"me013"::	Is - is that still sort of where it was, uh, the other day?::	0
"mn017"::	We're improving.::	0
"me013"::	We're  improving.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Now the - the - You saw the note that the P_L_P now is::	1
"me018"::	getting basically the same as the M_F_C_C. Right?::	1
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah. Actually it looks like it's getting  better.::	0
"me013"::	Oh.::	0
"mn017"::	So. But - but it's not -::	0
"me013"::	Just with - with age, kind of.::	0
"mn017"::	With age. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	But, uh,::	0
"mn017"::	that's not d- directly related to me. Doesn't mean we can't  talk  about it.::	0
"mn017"::	Um,::	0
"mn017"::	it seems - It looks l- I haven't -::	0
"mn017"::	The - It's -::	0
"mn017"::	The experiment is still not complete, but,::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	1
"mn017"::	it looks like the::	0
"mn017"::	vocal tract length normalization is working  beautifully,::	0
"mn017"::	actually,::	1
"mn017"::	w- using the warp factors that we computed for the S_R_I system and just applying them to the  ICSI front-end.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	That's pretty funny.  O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So you just need to  copy over to this one.::	0
"mn017"::	Just had to take the  reciprocal  of the number because::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	@@::	0
"mn017"::	they have different meanings in the two systems.::	0
"me013"::	Ah!::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Well, that's always good to do. O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K. Uh -::	0
"mn017"::	But  one  issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and - and  Don::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	was, um, as far as  meeting  recognition is concerned,::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	0
"mn017"::	we would really like to, uh, move, uh, to, uh, doing the recognition on automatic segmentations.::	0
"mn017"::	Because in all our previous::	1
"mn017"::	experiments, we had the -::	0
"mn017"::	uh, you know, we were essentially cheating by having the,::	0
"mn017"::	um,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, the h- the hand-segmentations as the basis of the recognition.::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	And so now with Thilo's  segmenter  working so  well,  I think we should  consider::	1
"mn014"::	Mmm. So.::	0
"me001"::	Come on.::	0
"mn017"::	doing a -::	1
"mn014"::	Yeah. We - But -::	0
"me013"::	Y- think - you think we should increase the error rate. Good.::	0
"mn017"::	uh, doing -::	0
"mn014"::	Anyway. Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	That- that's what  I  wanted to do  anyway,  so we should just::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And even -::	1
"mn014"::	get together and -::	0
"fe016"::	The good thing is that::	0
"fe016"::	since you, um, have high recall,  even if you have low precision cuz you're over-generating, that's  good  because we could train::	1
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	noise  models in the recognizer for these kinds of,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	uh,  transients  and things that come from the  microphones,  but::	1
"fe016"::	I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform,::	0
"fe016"::	we do  very  poorly because we're -::	0
"fe016"::	we're getting insertions in places what - that you may well be cutting out. So we  do  need  some  kind of pre-segmentation.::	1
"mn017"::	Well -::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	We should - we should consider doing some  extra  things, like, um,::	1
"mn017"::	you know, retraining or adapting the -::	0
"fe016"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn017"::	the models for background noise to the - to this environment, for instance.::	1
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And, yeah, using Thilo's,::	1
"mn017"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	you know, posteriors or  some  kind of - or -::	1
"fe016"::	right now they're - they're::	0
"fe016"::	discrete,::	0
"fe016"::	yes  or  no  for a speaker,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	to::	0
"fe016"::	consider those  particular  speaker background models. So.::	0
"fe016"::	There's lots of ins- interesting things that could be done.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah. We should do that.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Good.::	0
"me013"::	So, uh, why don't we,::	0
"me013"::	uh, do the I_B_M stuff?::	0
"me013"::	You had some  thing about that?::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. So, um, talked with Brian and gave him the::	0
"me018"::	alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me018"::	generated before.::	0
"me018"::	And so -::	0
"me013"::	The, uh, Chuck chunks.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.  The Chuck chunks. Right.::	0
"mn014"::	Hmm.::	0
"me018"::	And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the::	1
"me018"::	easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu- a number, a digit, and then a beep,::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	uh, at the beginning of each one and that would help::	1
"me018"::	keep them from getting lost.::	0
"me018"::	And, um,::	1
"me018"::	so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style, uh, beeps and so we're -::	1
"mn017"::	Where'd you get the  digits  from?::	0
"me018"::	I  came up  here  and just recorded the numbers one through ten.::	0
"fe008"::	They sound  really   good.::	0
"me018"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	That's a great idea.::	0
"me018"::	Does it sound O_K?::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	So, um - Yeah. We just used those.::	0
"mn017"::	And do you splice them into the  waveform? Or - ?::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. He - then he d- I recorded - Actually, I recorded one through ten  three  times at three different speeds and then he picked.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	He liked the  fastest  one, so he just cut those out::	0
"me018"::	and spliced  them   in between, uh, two beeps.::	0
"mn014"::	It will be funny uh -::	0
"fe008"::	It sounds like a radio announcer's voice. Really.::	0
"me018"::	Does it?::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	It will be funny when you're  really   reading   digits,  and then there are the chunks with - with your  digits in?::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. With my -::	0
"fe016"::	Oh, right.::	0
"fe008"::	Oh that's right.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Now actually,::	0
"me018"::	That'll throw  them,   huh?::	0
"fe008"::	we're - Are we handling - ?::	0
"me013"::	Uh,  maybe  we should have you record A_, B_, C_ for those or something.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Huh! Maybe. And she said it wasn't gonna - the  transcriber  said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a  template,::	0
"me018"::	uh, that has beep, number, beep. So for  them  it'll be very quick::	0
"mn014"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	to - to put those in there::	0
"me018"::	when they're transcribing.::	0
"me018"::	So, um, we - We're gonna send  them   one more sample meeting, uh, and Thilo has run his segmentation. Adam's gonna generate the::	1
"me018"::	chunked file.::	1
"me018"::	And then, um,::	1
"me018"::	I'll give it to Brian and they can try that out. And when we get that back we'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with, uh,::	1
"me018"::	too many beeps in the last transcription.::	1
"me013"::	O_K. Do w- do - what - Do you have any idea of the turn-around on - on those steps you just said?::	1
"fe016"::	Great.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me018"::	Uh.::	0
"me018"::	Our s- our - On  our  side?  or  including  I_B_M's?::	0
"me013"::	Including I_B_M's.::	0
"me018"::	Well,  I  don't know. The  last  one seemed like it took a couple of weeks.::	1
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me018"::	Um, maybe even  three.::	1
"me018"::	Uh, that's just the I_B_ M  side.::	1
"me018"::	Our  side is quick. I mean, I - I don't know. How long does your - ?::	0
"mn014"::	It  should   @@  be finished today or something. Yeah.::	1
"me013"::	Well, I meant the overall thing. e- e- u- u-  The  reason  I'm asking is because, uh,  Jane  and I have just been talking, and she's just been::	1
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	doing.   Uh, e- a, you know, further hiring of  transcribers.  And so we don't sort of  really  know::	1
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	exactly what they'll be doing, how long they'll be doing it, and so forth, because right now::	1
"me013"::	she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have  working.  And, uh,::	1
"me018"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	so it'd be - It'd be good to sort of get that resolved, uh, soon as we could, and then -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.  I - Yeah, I - I hope::	0
"me018"::	@@   we can get a better estimate from this  one that we send  them.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0

"me018"::	I - I don't know yet::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Um -::	0
"me018"::	how long that'll take.::	0

"me013"::	have  a stream going and we know how - how well it does and how -::	0

"me018"::	Right. Right.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0

"me013"::	Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing, maybe you could say relevant stuff about::	0

"fe008"::	O_K. So, um, we -::	1
"fe008"::	Uh, the transcribers have continued to work past what I'm calling "set one", which was the s- the set that I've been, uh -::	1
"fe008"::	O_K,::	0
"fe008"::	talking about up to this point, but,::	1
"fe008"::	uh, they've gotten five meetings done in  that  set.::	1
"fe008"::	Right now they're in the process of being  edited.::	0
"fe008"::	Um, the, um -::	0
"fe008"::	Let's see, I hired two transcribers today. I'm thinking of hiring  another  one, which will - because we've had a lot of  attrition.::	1

"mn017"::	Oh,  that  was an unfor- unforeseen side effect of -::	0

"fe008"::	And, um - Well, I don't mean - I don't mean anything against the others.  What I mean is we've got a good::	0
"fe008"::	cause - a good  core.  No. We had a good core -::	0
"fe016"::	Well, they won't  hear  this since they're going. They won't be transcribing this meeting.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, but still. I mean, I d- it's just a matter of we - w- we're - we've got, uh,::	0
"me013"::	No backs.::	0
"fe008"::	two of the ones who - who, um, ha- had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they're continuing to put in a - a lot of hours, which is wonderful, and excellent work.::	0
"fe008"::	And so, then, in addition, um, I hired::	0
"fe008"::	two more today and I'm planning to h- hire a third one with this - within this coming week, but -::	0
"fe008"::	but the plan is - just as, uh, Morgan was saying we discussed this, and::	0
"fe008"::	the plan right now is to keep the staff on the - on the::	0
"fe008"::	leaner  side, you know, rather than hiring, like, eight to  ten  right now,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	because if the I_B_M thing comes through really  quickly,::	0
"fe008"::	then, um,::	0
"fe008"::	we wouldn't wanna have to,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, you know, lay people  off  and stuff. So.::	0
"fe008"::	And this way it'll - I mean, I got  really  a  lot  of  response  for - for my notice and I think I could::	0
"fe008"::	hire  additional people if I  wish to.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. An- and the other thing is, I mean,::	0
"me013"::	in the unlikely event - and since we're so far from this, it's a little hard to::	0
"me013"::	plan  this way - in the unlikely event that we  actually  find::	0
"me013"::	that we have, uh, transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because, you know, there's, you know,::	0
"me013"::	all the stuff that - that was sitting there has been transcribed and they're - and they're faster - the - the pipeline is faster than -::	0
"me013"::	uh, than the  generation,::	0
"me013"::	um,::	0
"me013"::	eh, i-::	0
"me013"::	in - in the day - e- event that that day  actually   dawns,  uh, I - I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do. So I - I think::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, yes.::	0
"me013"::	that, eh,::	0
"me013"::	eh, a- as we were talking, if we - if we hire  twelve,  then::	0
"me013"::	we  could,  you know, run into a problem later. I mean, we also just couldn't sustain that forever. But - but, um -::	0
"me013"::	for all sorts of reasons - but if we hire f-::	1
"me013"::	you know, f- we have  five  on staff - five or six on staff at any given time, then::	0
"me013"::	it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way.::	1
"fe008"::	Good.  O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Good.::	0
"fe016"::	It'd be great, too, if, um,::	0
"fe016"::	we can - we  might  need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand -::	0
"fe016"::	to experiment with, um -::	0
"fe016"::	you know, to have a ground truth for this segmentation work, which - I guess you have some already that was really helpful, and we could probably use more.::	0
"mn014"::	Mmm, yeah. That was a thing I - I planned working on, is, uh, to use the - the transcriptions which are done by now, and to - to use them as, uh - Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	Oh, the  new  ones with the  tighter  boundaries. Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	And to use them for - for training a - or for - fo- whatever. Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	To - to create some speech-nonspeech labels out of them,::	0
"mn014"::	and - Yeah, but::	0
"mn014"::	that - that's a thing w- was - w-::	0
"mn014"::	what I'm just looking into.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	The - the - the pre-segmentations are so much - are s- so extremely helpful.::	1
"fe008"::	Now there was, uh, I g- guess - So, a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and::	0
"fe008"::	it happened to be during the time that he was on  vacation   - f- for just  very  few days you were away.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	But it happened to be during that time I needed one, so I -  so I started them on the::	0
"fe008"::	non-pre-segmented and then switched them over to yours and, um,::	0
"fe008"::	they, um - you know, they always appreciate that when they have that available. And he's, uh, usually, eh, uh, um -::	0
"fe008"::	Um. So they really appreciate it. But I was gonna say that they  do  adjust it once in a while. You know, once in a while there's something like,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah, sure.::	0
"fe008"::	um, and e- Actually you  talked  to them. Didn't you? Did you? Have you - ?::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	I talked to Helen.::	0
"fe008"::	And - and - and she was -::	0
"fe008"::	And so, I asked her - I mean,::	0
"fe008"::	They're very perceptive. I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers. I haven't done it yet, but I wanna do that and she's out of town,::	0
"fe008"::	um, for a couple of weeks, but I wanna do that when she returns.::	0
"fe008"::	Um,::	0
"fe008"::	cuz she was saying, you know, in a - in a span of very short period - we asked - It seems like the ones that::	0
"fe008"::	need to be adjusted are these - these - these things, and she was saying the short utterances, uh, the, um -::	0
"fe016"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn014"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	you know, I mean, you're - You're  aware  of this.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	But - but  actually  i- it's  so  correct for  so  much of the time, that it's an enormous time saver and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries.::	1
"fe016"::	That's great.::	0
"fe008"::	So.::	0
"fe008"::	Um. Yeah. I think it'd be interesting to  combine  these.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Is there actually a record of::	0
"fe016"::	where they change? I mean, you can compare, do a diff on the - just so that we  knew -::	0
"fe008"::	You could do it. It's - it's complicated in that::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	um,  hhh, i- hhh, i-::	0
"mn014"::	Actually, when - when they create new -::	0
"mn014"::	yeah, new segments or something,::	0
"mn014"::	it will be, uh, not that easy but - hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, if we keep a old copy of the old time marks just so that if we run it we know whether we're - which ones were cheating and::	0
"mn014"::	I think  one could do that.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	That would be great, yeah, to know that.::	0
"fe016"::	which one would be good.::	0
"fe008"::	There is a - there is one problem with that and that is when they  start  part way through then what I do is I  merge  what they've done with the pre-segmented version. So it's not a pure -::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	it's not a pure condition. Wha- what you'd  really  like is that::	1
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	they started with pre-segmented and were pre-segmented all the way through.::	1
"fe008"::	And, um -  @@   - I, uh - the -::	0
"fe008"::	it  wasn't  possible for about four of the recent ones.::	0
"fe008"::	But, it  will  be possible in the future because we - we're, um.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	@@::	0
"fe016"::	Mmm, that's great.::	0
"mn014"::	It would.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. As long as we have a record, I guess, of::	1
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	the original  automatic one, we can always find out::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	how well  we would do fr- from the recognition side by using those boundaries.::	1
"fe016"::	Um.::	0
"fe016"::	You know, a  completely  non-cheating version. Also if you need someone to record this meeting, I mean, I'm happy to - for the transcribers -::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	I could do it, or Chuck or Adam.::	0
"fe008"::	Thank you.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	So, uh, u- you were saying something about::	0
"me013"::	organizing the meeting info?::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. So, um,::	1
"me018"::	uh, Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the::	0
"me018"::	reorganization of the  directory structure for all of the meeting -::	1
"me013"::	Did you record it?::	0
"me018"::	No.::	0
"me018"::	For all the Meeting Recorder data.  We  should  have.::	1
"me018"::	Um.::	0
"me018"::	And so we've got a plan for what we're gonna do  there.  And then, Jane also s- prepared a -::	1
"me018"::	um, started getting all of the - the meetings organized, so she prepared a -::	0
"me018"::	a spreadsheet, which I spent the last couple of days adding to.::	1
"me018"::	So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far, and have been::	1
"me018"::	putting it into,::	0
"me018"::	uh, a spreadsheet::	0
"me018"::	with start time, the date, the  old  meeting name, the new meeting name, the number of speakers, the duration of the meeting, comments, you know, what its transcription status is, all that kind of stuff.::	1
"me018"::	And so, the idea is that we can take this::	1
"me018"::	and then export it as H_T_M_L and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what's going on.::	1
"fe016"::	Oh, great.::	0
"me018"::	Um, I've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some -::	0
"me018"::	some::	0
"me018"::	gaps here that I need to get her to fill in, but::	1
"me018"::	so far, um,::	0
"me018"::	as of Monday, the fourteenth,::	0
"me018"::	um, we've::	0
"me018"::	had a total number of meeting- sixty-two hours of meetings that we have::	0
"me018"::	collected.::	1
"me018"::	And, um -::	0
"me018"::	Uh, some other interesting things, average number of speakers per meeting is six.::	1
"me018"::	Um,::	0
"me018"::	and I'm gonna have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far, but I've got a bunch of -::	1
"me018"::	uh, that's what I have to talk to Jane about, figuring out exactly which ones have -::	0
"me018"::	have been completed and so forth.::	0
"me018"::	But, um,::	0
"me018"::	this'll be a nice thing that we can::	0
"me018"::	put up on the - the web site and people can::	0
"me018"::	be informed of the status of various::	0
"me018"::	different ones. And  it'll also list, uh, like under the status, if it's at I_B_M or if it's at ICSI,::	1
"me018"::	uh, or if it's completed or which ones we're excluding and - and there's a place for comments, so we can,::	1
"me018"::	um, say why we're excluding things and so forth. So.::	0
"me013"::	Now would the ones that, um, are already transcribed - we h- we have enough there that c-::	0
"me013"::	you know, we've already done some studies and so forth and -::	0
"me013"::	um, shouldn't we go through and do the business -es u- of - of having the,::	0
"me013"::	um,::	0
"me013"::	uh, participants approve it, uh, for - approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth?::	0
"fe008"::	Um, interesting idea. In principle, I - I would say yes, although I still am doing some - the final-pass editing,::	0
"fe008"::	trying to convert it over to the master file as the -::	0
"fe008"::	being the  channelized  version and it's -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes  and I have to stop.::	0
"fe008"::	Cleaning up the things like the, uh, uh, places where the transcriber was uncertain, and -::	0
"fe008"::	and doing spot-checking here and there.::	0
"fe008"::	So, um,::	0
"fe008"::	uh, I guess::	0
"fe008"::	it would make sense to wait  until   th- that's  done,::	0
"fe008"::	um, but - but -::	0
"me013"::	Well, le- let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of - as - as I did with the, uh, uh - the - the pipeline.::	1
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um, we  are  gonna have this DARPA  meeting in the middle of July, and I think it w- it'd be -::	1
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	given that we've been - we've given a couple public talks about it already, spaced by months and months, I think it'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available.::	1
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"fe008"::	It'll  certainly  be done by then. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right. So we can s- we - we wanna be able to say "here is a subset that is available right now"::	1
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	That's right.::	0
"me013"::	and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth. So.::	1
"fe008"::	That's right.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. That's right. So that -::	0
"me013"::	O_K?::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	So,::	0
"mn017"::	And they don't have to approve,::	1
"me013"::	by - before July.::	0
"mn017"::	you know, th- an edited version, they can just::	0
"mn017"::	give their approval to whatever::	0
"me013"::	Well, in  principle,   yes.  But, I mean, i- if - if - if somebody actually  did  get into some legal issue with it then we-::	1
"fe008"::	Well, maybe -::	0
"mn017"::	version::	1
"mn017"::	Bu-::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah. But th- I mean, the editing will continue. Presumably if - if s- errors are found, they will be fixed,::	1
"mn017"::	but they won't change the -::	0
"me018"::	Content,  really.::	0
"mn017"::	the content of the meetings. So.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, see, this is the - this is the issue. Subtleties.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, i- if Jane is clarifying question question, then, you know, how can they agree to it before they know her final version?::	0
"fe008"::	The  other  thing, too, is there can be  subtleties  where a person uses  this  word instead of  that  word, which  @@   could've been transcribed in the other way.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Thing -::	0
"fe008"::	And no- and they wouldn't have   been  slanderous if it had been this other word. You know?::	0
"me013"::	I- it - you know, there- there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because, you know, you could  do  this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say, you know, that should be a period and not a question mark. Right?::	1
"me013"::	And you don't - you - there's no  way  that we're gonna go back and ask everybody "do you approve this, uh, you know - this document now?" So -::	0
"me013"::	So I think what it is is that the -::	0
"me013"::	the - the - the  thing  that they  sign  - I - I haven't looked at it in a while, but it has to be open enough that it sort of says::	0
"me013"::	"O_K, from now on - you know, now that I've read this, you can use - do anything you want::	0
"me013"::	with these data."::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And, uh - But, i- I think we wanna - So,::	0
"me013"::	assuming  that it's in that kind of wording, which I don't remember,::	0
"me013"::	um, I think i- we just wanna have enough confidence  ourselves::	0
"me013"::	that it's so close::	0
"me013"::	to the final form it's gonna be  in,  a year from now that they're -::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm. I agree.::	0
"fe008"::	Mmm. I totally agree.  It's just, uh, a question of,::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"fe008"::	uh, if - if the person is using the  transcript  as the way of them judging::	0
"fe008"::	what they said and whether it was slanderous,  then it seems like it's - it's - i-::	0
"fe008"::	it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re-listening to the meeting.::	0
"fe008"::	Because it becomes, eh, in a way a -::	0
"fe008"::	a f- uh, a legal  document  i- if they've agreed to that.::	0
"me013"::	Well, I forget how we end-::	0
"me013"::	Right. I forget how we ended up on this, but I remember my taking the position::	0
"me013"::	of not making it so - so easy for everybody to::	0
"me013"::	observe everything and Adam was taking the position of - of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it  including  the audio.::	0
"me013"::	And I don't remember who won, Adam or me, but -::	0
"me013"::	uh, the -::	0
"fe008"::	Well,  if it's only the transcript, though - I mean, th- this - this is my point, that - that::	0
"me013"::	Uh, that- that's why I'm bringing this up again, because I can't remember how we ended up.::	0
"fe008"::	then it becomes -::	0
"me013"::	That it  was  the transcrip- He wanted to do a web interface that would make it -::	0
"fe008"::	Well, if it's just the audio -::	0
"fe008"::	Well.::	0
"me013"::	that would give you access to the transcript  and  the audio. That's what Adam wanted.::	1
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And I don't remember how we ended up.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, with the  web  interface it's interesting, because you could::	0
"fe016"::	allow the person who  signs  to be  informed  when their transcript changes,::	0
"fe016"::	or something like  that.  And, I mean, I would say " no ". Like, I don't wanna know, but some people might be really::	0
"fe016"::	interested and then y-::	0
"fe016"::	In other words,::	0
"fe016"::	they would::	0
"fe016"::	be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that.::	0
"me013"::	You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were -::	0
"fe016"::	Well,::	0
"fe016"::	I don't know what happened to the small heads thing, but I j-::	0
"fe016"::	Um, I'm just saying that, like, you know, you can sort of::	0
"fe016"::	say that any things that are deemed -::	0
"me013"::	They disappeared from view.::	1
"fe016"::	Anyway. I mean, I agree that at some point people::	0
"fe016"::	probably won't care about  typos  but they would care about significant  meaning  changes and then::	0
"fe016"::	they could be::	0
"fe016"::	asked for their  consent,  I  guess,  if -  if  those change. Cuz assumi-::	0
"fe016"::	assuming we - we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign  anyway.::	0
"mn017"::	Tha-::	0
"mn017"::	That's -::	0
"mn017"::	How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts?::	0
"fe016"::	Oh, my God.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"fe008"::	That would be simpler, if we could count on them listening.::	0
"me018"::	Talk.::	0
"fe016"::	But no one will  listen  to the hours and hours of -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, that's O_ K.  We just have to give them a  chance  to listen to it, and if they  don't,  that's  their  problem.::	0
"me001"::	That's - hmm, hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	You - you d-::	0
"fe008"::	Well.::	0
"fe016"::	That's like -::	0
"fe008"::	Unfortunately, uh, in - in the sign- thing that they signed, it says " transcripts ". "You'll be - you'll be provided the transcripts when they're available."::	1
"mn017"::	No, I'm serious.::	0
"mn017"::	Really?::	0
"fe016"::	I- I - I think::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me001"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe016"::	that's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	W- anyway, haven't we - we've gone down this path a number of times. I know this can lead to extended conversations and - and  not  really  get  anywhere, so let - let me just suggest that -::	1
"me013"::	uh, off-line that, uh, the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it's July.::	1
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	O_K. So - so that  in  July we can tell people::	0
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	"yes, we have this and you can use it".::	0
"fe008"::	It's done, ready, available.::	0
"fe008"::	Good.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me013"::	So, let's see. What else we got?::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me013"::	Don did - did a report about his project in class and, uh -::	0
"me013"::	an oral and written - written version. So that was stuff he was doing with you.::	0
"fe016"::	Well.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, it's - I guess one thing we're learning is that the amount - We have::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	eight meetings there because we couldn't use the non-native -  all  non-native meetings and::	1

"fe016"::	well,  probably   below  threshold on enough data for us for the things we're looking at because the::	1
"fe016"::	prosodic features are  very noisy and so you - you need a lot of data in order to model them.::	1
"fe016"::	Um, so we're  starting  to see  some  patterns and we're hoping that maybe with,::	1

"fe016"::	some  local,::	0
"fe016"::	um,::	0
"fe016"::	range - pitch range effects, like how close people are to their floor,  are  showing up in these classifiers,::	1

"fe016"::	So, we're  starting  to see, I think, some::	0

"fe016"::	Um,::	0
"mn017"::	Spurts wouldn't be. Right?::	0
"fe016"::	spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words, but  roughly  speaking, the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position. It's either early or late.::	1
"me001"::	Right.::	0

"fe016"::	Yeah, uh, we didn't try it, but it's s-::	0

"me001"::	Right.::	0

"fe016"::	And it depends on speaking rate -::	0

"fe016"::	I guess  you  reported on some te- punctuation type - finding sentence boundaries, finding::	1
"me001"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	disfluency boundaries, and then I had done some work on::	1
"fe016"::	finding from the  foreground  speech  whether  or not someone was likely to  interrupt,  so where -::	1
"fe016"::	you know, if I'm talking  now  and someone - and - and Andreas is about to interrupt me, is he gonna choose a certain  place  in my speech, either prosodically or  word-based.::	1
"fe016"::	And  there  the prosodic features::	1
"fe016"::	actually  showed  up::	1
"fe016"::	and::	0
"fe016"::	a  neat  thing - even though the word features were  available.::	1
"fe016"::	And a  neat  thing there  too  is I tried some -::	1
"fe016"::	putting the  speaker  - So, I gave everybody::	1
"fe016"::	a short version of their  name.  So the real names are in there, which we  couldn't  use.::	1
"fe016"::	Uh, we should use I_Ds or something.::	0
"fe016"::	And  those  don't show up. So that means that overall,::	1
"fe016"::	um, it wasn't  just  modeling Morgan, or it wasn't  just  modeling a single  person,::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	um,::	0
"fe016"::	but was sort of trying to,::	0
"fe016"::	uh, get a  general  idea - the model - the tree classifier was trying to::	0
"fe016"::	find  general  locations that were applicable to different speakers,  even  though there are huge  speaker  effects. So.::	0
"fe016"::	The - but the main limitation now is I -::	0
"fe016"::	because we're only looking at things that happen every::	0
"fe016"::	ten  words  or every  twenty  words, we need more -::	0
"fe016"::	more data and more data per speaker.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	It'd also be interesting to look at the E_D_U meetings because we  did  include meeting  type::	0
"fe016"::	as a feature, so::	0
"fe016"::	whether you were in a r-::	0
"fe016"::	Meeting Recorder meeting or a  Robustness  meeting  did  matter::	0
"fe016"::	to   interrupts  because there are just fewer  interrupts  in the Robustness meetings.::	0
"me001"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person, which is::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	not  bad.  It'd probably do better than -::	0

"fe016"::	The other thing that was interesting to me is that the  pitch  features are  better  than in Switchboard.::	1

"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0

"fe016"::	We had a big missing data problem in  Switchboard::	0
"fe016"::	and, so the features weren't as reliable cuz they were often just not available. So  that's  actually good.::	0
"me018"::	Could it have to do with the - the lower  frequency  cut-off on the  Switchboard?::	1
"fe016"::	Ma- maybe. I mean, the tele- we had  telephone  bandwidth for Switchboard::	1

"me013"::	just take  care  of the problem. So I put in a high-pass filter::	0
"me013"::	at, uh, I think ninety -::	0
"me013"::	ninety hertz or so::	0
"me013"::	uh, for a sixteen kilohertz  sampling  rate.::	0
"me013"::	And I  never  put anything in::	0
"me013"::	to  adjust  it for  different   - different  sampling  rates.::	0
"me013"::	And so - well, so, you know, the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty- five  hertz instead of at -::	0
"mn017"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	instead of at ninety. So, um,::	0
"me013"::	I don't know if Dan::	0
"me013"::	fixed it or -::	0
"me013"::	or, uh,::	0
"mn017"::	Well, he made it a  parameter.::	0
"me013"::	what he -::	0
"me013"::	He  made  it a  parameter.  So. Yeah, I  guess  if he did it right, he  did  fix it and then - and then it's taking care of  sampling  rate, which is great.::	0
"me018"::	What - what is the parameter? Is it, uh, just the f- lower cut-off that you want?::	0
"me013"::	He had a -::	0
"mn017"::	It's called, uh,  H_- H_P_F.::	0
"me013"::	H_ -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.  Does   H_P_F on - on his feat- feature.::	0
"mn017"::	u- And - but H_P_F, you know, when you put a  number  after it, uses that as the::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	hertz value of the  cut-off.  So.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"me013"::	I mean,::	0
"me013"::	frankly,  we  never  did that with the  RASTA  filter  either,  so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you're doing, which is  another old - old bug of mine.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	But, um -::	0
"me013"::	Um. So that -  that  was the problem  there  was th- we - we - we had always  intended  to cut off below a hundred hertz and it just::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	wasn't doing it, so  now  it  is.  So,::	0
"me013"::	that hep- that helped us by, like, eight tenths of a percent. It  still wasn't a big deal.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	Well, but, um -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, uh, again, after completing the  current experiments, we'll -::	0
"mn017"::	we can add up all the::	0
"me013"::	Oh, yeah. But -::	0
"mn017"::	uh::	0
"mn017"::	differences and -  and - an-::	0
"me013"::	but, I guess my - my point was that - that, um,::	0
"me013"::	the::	0
"me013"::	hybrid  system thing that we did::	0
"me013"::	was, uh,::	0
"me013"::	primitive in  many  ways.::	0
"mn017"::	Y- Right.::	0
"me013"::	And I think I  agree  with you that if we::	1
"me013"::	fixed  lots  of different things and  they would all add  up, we would probably have a - a - a competitive  system.::	1
"me013"::	But I think not that much of it is due to the front-end per se. I think maybe a couple percent of it is, as far as I can see from this.::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, unless you call - well, if you call V_T_L the front-en- front-end, that's, uh, a little more.::	0
"me013"::	But that's sort of more  both,  kind of. Right? But.::	0
"me018"::	One experiment we should -::	0
"me018"::	we'll probably need to do though when -::	0
"me018"::	um,::	0
"me018"::	at some point, is, since we're using that same - the net that was trained on P_L_P::	0
"me018"::	without all these things in it, for the  tandem  system,::	0
"me018"::	we may wanna go back and retrain,::	0
"mn017"::	Well,  that's  what I  meant,  in fact. Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	yeah, yeah,::	0
"me018"::	for the  tandem.  You know, so we can see if it - what effect it has on the  tandem::	0
"me018"::	processing.::	0
"mn017"::	So - so, the thing is - is::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	do we expect - ?::	0
"mn017"::	eh  At this point I'm as- I mean, you know -::	1
"mn017"::	e- I'm wondering is it -::	0
"mn017"::	Can we expect, uh, a tandem system to do  better  than a properly trained - you know, a Gaussian::	0
"mn017"::	system trained directly on the features with, you know, the right ch- choice of  parameters?::	1
"me013"::	Well,  that's  what we're seeing in other  areas.  Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"me013"::	So, it's - so, um,::	0
"me013"::	um -::	0
"me018"::	So, we - But - but we may not. I mean, if it  doesn't  perform as  well,  we may not know  why.  Right? Cuz we need to do::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me018"::	the exact  experiment.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, the  reason  to think it  should  is because::	0
"me013"::	you're putting in::	0
"me013"::	the same information and you're transforming it to be more discriminative.::	0
"me013"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	Now the thing is, in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you  much  and - and  part  of what I view as the real power of it is that::	0
"me013"::	it  gives you a transformational capability::	0
"me013"::	for taking all  sorts  of different wild things that we do, not just th- the  standard  front-end, but  other  things, like with multiple  streams  and so forth,::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	and allows you to feed  them   to the other system with this - through this funnel.::	0
"me013"::	Um, so I think - I think that's the  real  power of it. I wouldn't expect huge in-  huge  improvements.::	0
"me013"::	Um, but::	0
"me013"::	it should at  least  be::	0
"me013"::	roughly the  same  and maybe a little  better.  If it's, you know, like way way worse then, you know -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me018"::	So, Morgan, an-  another  thing that Andreas and I were talking about was, so  @@   in the  first  experiment that he did::	0
"me018"::	we just took the whole::	0
"me018"::	fifty-six, uh, outputs and that's, um,::	0
"me018"::	basically compared to a thirty-nine input feature vector::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	from either M_F_C_C or P_L_P.::	0
"me018"::	But one thing we  could  do is -::	0
"me013"::	Let - let me - let me just ask you something. When you say take the fifty-six  outputs,   these are the pre-::	0
"me013"::	final nonlinearity  outputs and they're - and -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. Through the regular tandem outputs.::	0
"me013"::	through the K_L_T.::	0
"me018"::	Through the K_L_T. All that kinda stuff.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	And so - so then you u- Do you use all fifty-six of the K_L_T or - ?::	0
"me018"::	That's what we did. Right?::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me018"::	So  one  thing we were  wondering  is, if we did::	0
"me018"::	principal components and, say, took out just  thirteen,  and then did deltas and double-deltas on  that  - so we treated the th-::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"me018"::	first thirteen as though they were::	0
"me018"::	standard features.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	I mean, did Dan do experiments like that to - ?::	0
"me013"::	Uh. Talk with Stephane.::	0
"me013"::	He  did some things like that.::	0
"me013"::	It was either him or Carmen. I forget.::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	I mean these were all different databases and different - you know, in H_T_K and all that, so i- it - it  may  not  apply.  But::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse.::	0
"me018"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	But, again, given all these differences, maybe it's more important in your case that you  not  take a lot of these low-variance, uh, components.::	0
"me018"::	Cuz in a  sense,  the  net's  already  got  quite a bit of  context  in::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	those  features,  so if we did deltas and double-deltas on top of  those,::	0
"me018"::	we're getting::	0
"me018"::	sort of even  more.::	0
"me013"::	Which could be good or not. Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Worth trying.::	0
"mn017"::	But there the main::	1
"mn017"::	point is that, um,::	0
"mn017"::	you know, it took us a while but we have the::	0
"mn017"::	procedure  for coupling the two systems::	0
"mn017"::	debugged now and -::	1
"mn017"::	I mean, there's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we're feeding the::	0
"mn017"::	tandem features - uh, either  generating  them or feeding them to this - to the::	1
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	S_R_I system, but::	1
"me013"::	There  might  be, cuz that's a pretty big difference.::	0
"mn017"::	it's -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But::	0
"mn017"::	And I'm wondering how we can -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	how we can debug that. I mean how -::	0
"mn017"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	I'm actually f- quite sure that the -::	0
"me013"::	What if - ?::	0
"mn017"::	feeding the  features into the system and training it up, that - that -::	1
"mn017"::	I think that's -::	0
"mn017"::	this - that's essentially the same as we use with the ce- with the P_L_ P  fe- features.::	1
"mn017"::	And that's obviously working  great.  So.::	0
"mn017"::	I- um.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. There could be a bug in - in the -::	1
"mn017"::	There - we could -::	0
"me018"::	somewhere before that.::	1
"mn017"::	the -  another  degree of  freedom  is how do you generate the K_L_ T  transform?::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	That's -::	0
"mn017"::	Right? We to-::	0
"me018"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	well, and  another  one is the normalization of the inputs to the  net.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	These nets are trained with particular normalization  and  when that gets screwed up it - it can really hurt it.::	0
"me018"::	I'm doing what Eric -::	0
"me018"::	E- Eric coached me through then - that part of it, so I'm pretty confident in  that.  I mean, the only::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me018"::	slight  difference is that I use normalization values that,::	0
"me018"::	um,::	0
"me018"::	Andreas calculated::	0
"me018"::	from the  original   P_L_P, which is right. N- Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me018"::	So,::	0
"me018"::	I u- I do -::	0
"me018"::	Oh, we actually don't  do  that normalization for the P_L_P,  do  we?::	0
"me018"::	For the st- just the straight P_L_P features?::	0
"mn017"::	No. The - the S_R_I system does it.::	0
"me018"::	S_R_ I  system does that. Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	Well, you might e- e-::	0
"me018"::	So that's - that's another -::	0
"mn017"::	So, there's - there is - there is room for bugs that we might not have::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.  I -::	1
"mn017"::	discovered, but -::	0
"me013"::	I would actually double check with  Stephane  at this point,::	1
"me013"::	cuz he's probably the one here -::	0
"me013"::	I mean, he and Dan are the ones who are at this point  most  experienced with the tandem::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	thing and there may - there may be some little::	0
"me013"::	bit here and there that is::	0
"me013"::	not - not being handled right.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah. It's  hard  with features, cuz you don't know what they  should  look like. I mean, you can't just, like,::	1
"me018"::	print the -::	0
"me018"::	the values out in ASCII and, you know, look at them, see if they're -::	1
"me013"::	Not unless you had a  lot  of time and -::	1
"fe016"::	Well -::	0
"fe016"::	eh, and also they're not - I mean, as I understand it, you - you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final  word  error. Right?::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean, these are just::	0
"fe016"::	discriminative, but they're not, um,::	0
"fe016"::	optimized for the final -::	0
"mn017"::	They're optimized for  phone  discrimination, not for -::	0
"fe016"::	Right. So it - there's always this question of whether you  might  do better with those features if there was a way to  train  it::	0
"me013"::	That's right.::	0
"me013"::	Well, the other -::	0
"fe016"::	for the  word  error metric that you're actually -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, th- the -::	0
"mn017"::	Mm- Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	Well, you actually  are.::	0
"fe016"::	that you're actually -::	0
"me013"::	But - but it - but in an indirect way.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, right. It's indirect, so you don't know -::	0
"me013"::	So wha- w- what - an- and you may  not  be in this case, come to think of it, because,::	0
"me013"::	uh, you're just taking something that's trained up  elsewhere.  So,::	0
"me013"::	what - what you - what you  do  in the  full  procedure::	0
"me013"::	is you, um,::	0
"me013"::	uh, have an embedded training.::	0
"me013"::	So in fact you - the - the net is trained::	0
"me013"::	on, uh, uh, a, uh, Viterbi alignment::	0
"me013"::	of the training data that comes from your full system. And so that's where the feedback comes all around, so that it  is  actually::	0
"me013"::	discriminant.::	0
"me013"::	You can prove that it's - it's a,::	0
"me013"::	uh -::	0
"me013"::	If you believe in the Viterbi assumption::	0
"me013"::	that, uh, getting the best path,::	0
"me013"::	uh, is almost equivalent to getting the best, uh, total probability,::	0
"me013"::	um, then::	0
"me013"::	you actually  do   improve  that::	0
"me013"::	by, uh - by training up on local -::	0
"me013"::	local, uh - local frames.::	0
"me013"::	But, um, we aren't actually doing that here, because we did - we did that::	0
"me013"::	for a  hybrid  system, and now we're plugging it into another system and so it isn't -::	0
"me013"::	i- i- i- it wouldn't quite apply here.::	0
"me018"::	So another huge experiment we could do would be to::	0
"mn017"::	Do y-::	0
"me018"::	take the tandem features,::	0
"me018"::	uh, do S_R_I::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me018"::	forced alignments using those features, and then re-do the net with those.::	0
"fe016"::	Mmm, uh - Exactly. Exactly.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So that you can optimize it for the  word  error.  Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.  Another  thing is since you're  not  using the net for  recognition  per se but just for this  transformation,  it's  probably   bigger  than it needs to be.::	0
"mn017"::	But -::	0
"me013"::	So that would save a lot of time.::	0
"mn017"::	And there's a mismatch in the phone sets.::	0
"me018"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn017"::	So, you're using a l- a long- a larger phone set than what -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. Actually all those things could - could - could - could, uh - could affect it as well.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	The  other  thing, uh, just to mention that  Stephane  - this was an innovation of  Stephane's,  which was a pretty  neat  one,::	1
"me013"::	uh, and might particularly apply  here, given all these things we're mentioning.::	1
"me013"::	Um, Stephane's idea was that, um, discriminant,::	1
"me013"::	uh, approaches are great.::	1
"me013"::	Even the local ones, given, you know, these potential outer loops which, you know, you can  convince  yourself::	1
"me013"::	turn into the global ones.::	1
"me013"::	Um,::	1
"me013"::	however,::	0
"me013"::	there's times when it  is not good.::	1
"me013"::	Uh, when  something about the test set is different enough from the training set that - that, uh, the discrimination that you're learning is - is - is not a good one.::	1
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	So, uh,  his  idea was to take as the input feature vector to the, uh, Gaussian mixture system,::	1
"me013"::	uh, a concatenation::	0
"me013"::	of the neural net outputs::	0
"me013"::	and the regular features.::	1
"fe016"::	Yeah. That -::	0
"mn017"::	Oh,  we  already talked about that.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Didn't you - did you   do  that already or - ?::	0
"mn017"::	El- Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	No, but we - we - when - when we - when I first started corresponding with  Dan  about how to go  about  this,::	0
"fe016"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	That makes a lot of sense. Huh.::	0
"mn017"::	I think that was one of the things that we definitely  went there .::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I mean, I'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to  think  of it, but actually Stephane  did  it and -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh-huh. And i- does it help?::	0
"me013"::	and - and it helped a  lot.  Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"me013"::	So that's - that - that's our current best - best system in the, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	Oh.  O_K.::	0
"me013"::	uh, in the  Aurora  thing. Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah. That makes sense.::	0
"mn017"::	And do you do a K_L_T transform on the con- on the  combined  feature vector?::	0
"fe016"::	As - you should never do  worse.::	0
"me013"::	I - I, uh, missed what you said.::	0
"mn017"::	Do you - d- you do a K_L_T transform on the  combined  feature vector?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Well, actually, I, uh - you should check with him, because he tried several different combinations.::	0
"mn017"::	Because you end up with this huge  feature  vector, so that might be a problem, a- unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. I, uh, th-::	0
"me013"::	what I don't remember is which came out  best.  So he did one where he put o- put e- the whole thing into one K_L_T,::	0
"me013"::	and  another  one, since the - the P_L_P things are already orthogonalized,::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	he left them alone::	0
"me013"::	and - and just did a K_L_T on the - on the - on the  net  outputs and then concatenated that.::	0
"mn017"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	And I don't remember which was better.::	0
"me018"::	Did he - did he try to - ?::	0
"me018"::	So he always ended up with a feature vector that was  twice as long as either one of the - ?::	0
"me013"::	No. I don't know, i- I - I don't know.::	0
"me013"::	You have to check with him.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K. Actually, I have to run.::	0
"me013"::	I'm into  big  ideas these days.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh.::	0
"fe016"::	We need to close up cuz I need to save the data and,::	0
"me013"::	@@   Not to  mention  the fact that we're missing  snacks.  Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	um, get a call.::	0
