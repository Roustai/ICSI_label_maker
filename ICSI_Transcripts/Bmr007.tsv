"me013"::	So, uh::	0
"me013"::	I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda::	0
"me013"::	to send it to me and no one did. So,::	0
"me011"::	So we  all   forgot.::	0
"me013"::	Uh,::	0
"fe008"::	From  last  time I wanted to - Uh::	0
"fe008"::	The - An iss- uh::	0
"fe008"::	one topic from last time.::	0
"me013"::	Right, s-::	0
"me013"::	O_K, so one item for an agenda is uh  Jane has some uh::	0
"me013"::	uh some research to talk about,::	0
"me013"::	research issues.::	0
"me013"::	Um::	0
"me013"::	and::	0
"me011"::	And I have some   short  research issues.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, Adam has some short research issues.::	0
"me013"::	Um, I have a::	0
"me013"::	list of things that I think were  done  over the last three months I was supposed to::	0
"me013"::	send off, uh::	0
"me013"::	and, um  I - I sent a note about it to uh - to Adam and Jane but I think I'll just run through it::	0
"me013"::	also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or::	0
"me013"::	uh insufficient.::	0
"me018"::	A list that you have to send off to  who?::	0
"me013"::	Uh, to uh uh, I_B_M.::	0
"me018"::	Oh.::	0
"mn005"::	@@::	0

"me013"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	So, uh  so, I'll go through that.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	And,::	0
"me013"::	Anything else?::	0
"me013"::	anyone wants to talk about?::	0
"me013"::	No. O_K.::	0
"me018"::	What about the, um - your  trip,  yesterday?::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	Sort of off-topic I guess. Cuz that's  Cuz that was all - all about the, uh -::	0
"me018"::	Oh, O_K.::	0
"me013"::	I - I - I can chat with you about that  off-line. That's another thing.::	0
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	And,::	0
"me013"::	Anything else?  Nothing else?::	0
"me013"::	Uh, there's a - I mean, there is a -  a, um::	0
"me013"::	uh::	0
"me013"::	telephone call tomorrow,::	0
"me013"::	which will be a conference call  that some of us are involved in::	0
"me013"::	for uh a possible proposal.::	0
"me013"::	Um, we'll talk - we'll talk about it next week if - if something -::	0
"me011"::	Do you want me to  be there for that?::	0
"me011"::	I noticed you C_ C'ed  me, but I wasn't actually a recipient.::	0
"me011"::	I didn't quite know what to make of that.::	0
"me013"::	Uh Well, we'll talk - talk about that after our meeting.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, O_K. So it sounds like the - the three main things that we have to talk about are, uh this list, uh Jane and - Jane and Adam have some research items, and, other than that, anything,::	0
"me013"::	as usual,::	0
"me013"::	anything goes beyond that.::	0
"me013"::	O_K, uh, Jane, since - since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours, make sure we get to it.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, it's - it's very::	0
"fe008"::	eh - it's  very brief, I mean - just let me - just hand these out. Oops.::	0
"me011"::	Is this the same as the email or different?::	0
"fe008"::	It's slightly different. I -::	0
"mn014"::	Thanks.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	basically  the same.::	0
"me018"::	Same idea?::	0
"fe008"::	But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so  Basically,  um::	1
"fe008"::	as you know, uh::	0
"fe008"::	part of the encoding::	0
"fe008"::	includes a mark that indicates  an overlap.::	1
"fe008"::	It's not indicated::	1
"fe008"::	with, um  uh, tight  precision,  it's just indicated that -::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, so,::	0
"fe008"::	It's indicated to - to - so the people know::	0
"fe008"::	what  parts of sp-::	0
"fe008"::	which - which stretches of speech were in the  clear,::	0
"fe008"::	versus being overlapped by others. So, I::	1
"fe008"::	used this mark and, um::	0
"fe008"::	and, uh  uh,::	0
"fe008"::	divided the -::	0
"fe008"::	I wrote a script::	0
"fe008"::	which divides things into individual minutes,::	0
"fe008"::	of which we ended up with forty  five, and a little bit.::	0
"fe008"::	And, uh::	0
"fe008"::	you know, minute zero, of course, is the first minute up to::	0
"fe008"::	sixty seconds.::	0
"mn014"::	O_K .::	0
"fe008"::	And, um::	1
"fe008"::	What you can see is the number of overlaps::	0
"fe008"::	and then::	0
"fe008"::	to the right,::	0
"fe008"::	whether they involve  two  speakers,  three  speakers, or  more  than three speakers.::	1
"fe008"::	And,::	0
"fe008"::	um  and,::	0
"fe008"::	what I was looking for sp- sp- specifically  was  the question of::	0
"fe008"::	whether they're distributed  evenly  throughout or whether they're::	0
"fe008"::	bursts  of them.::	0
"fe008"::	Um.::	0
"fe008"::	And  it looked to me as though -::	0
"fe008"::	uh, you know - y- this is just -::	1
"fe008"::	eh - eh, this would - this is  not  statistically::	0
"fe008"::	verified,::	0
"fe008"::	but it::	0
"fe008"::	did  look to me as though there are bursts  throughout,  rather than being::	0
"fe008"::	localized to a particular region.::	1
"fe008"::	The  part  down there, where there's the  maximum  number of -::	1
"fe008"::	of, um  overlaps is an area where we were discussing::	0
"fe008"::	whether or not it would be useful to indi- to s- to::	0
"fe008"::	code::	0
"fe008"::	stress,::	0
"fe008"::	uh,  sentence  stress::	0
"fe008"::	as possible indication of, uh   information  retrieval.::	1
"fe008"::	So it's like,::	0
"fe008"::	you know, rather,::	0
"fe008"::	lively discussion there.::	0
"me013"::	What was - what's the - the  parenthesized  stuff  that says, like -::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, th-::	0
"me013"::	e-  the first one that says  six  overlaps and then  two  point eight?::	0
"fe008"::	That's the per  cent.::	0
"me013"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe008"::	So,  six  is, uh  two point eight percent  of the total number of overlaps in the  session.::	0
"mn005"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Ah.::	0
"mn014"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	At the very end,::	0
"fe008"::	this is when people were,::	0
"fe008"::	you know, packing up to go basically, there's::	0
"fe008"::	this  final  stuff, I think we -::	0
"fe008"::	I don't remember  where  the digits  fell. I'd have to look at that. But::	0
"fe008"::	the final three there are no overlaps at all.::	0
"fe008"::	And  couple times there  are not. So, i- it seems like it goes through bursts::	0
"mn005"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	but, um  that's kind of it. Now,::	1
"mn005"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Another  question is::	0
"fe008"::	is there - are there::	0
"fe008"::	individual differences in whether you're likely to  be  overlapped  with  or to overlap with  others.::	1
"fe008"::	And, again  I want to emphasize this is just one  particular::	0
"fe008"::	um -::	0
"fe008"::	one particular meeting, and also there's been no statistical  testing  of it all, but::	0
"fe008"::	I, um::	0
"fe008"::	I took the coding of::	0
"fe008"::	the - I, you know, my - I had this script::	0
"fe008"::	figure out, um::	0
"fe008"::	who::	0
"fe008"::	was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two-person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more.::	0
"fe008"::	And, um::	0
"fe008"::	this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of::	0
"fe008"::	who tended to be overlapping most often with who -::	0
"fe008"::	who else, and::	0
"fe008"::	if you look at the  marginal  totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get::	0
"fe008"::	the totals for an  individual.  So,::	0
"fe008"::	um  If you::	0
"fe008"::	look at the  bottom,  those are the, um::	0
"fe008"::	numbers of overlaps in which::	0
"fe008"::	um  Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look -::	0
"fe008"::	I'm sorry, but you're o- alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you::	0
"fe008"::	And then if you look across the  right,::	0
"fe008"::	then  that's where he was the::	0
"fe008"::	person who was the sp- first  speaker  in the pair::	0
"fe008"::	and got overlap-::	0
"me018"::	Hmm!::	0
"fe008"::	overlapped  with by somebody.::	0
"mn005"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	And,  then if you look down in the  summary  table,::	0
"fe008"::	then you see that, um::	0
"fe008"::	th- they're differences in::	0
"fe008"::	whether a person got overlapped  with  or::	0
"fe008"::	overlapped::	0
"me011"::	Is this uh  just raw  counts  or is it -::	0
"fe008"::	by.::	0
"fe008"::	Raw counts.::	0
"me011"::	So it would be interesting to see::	0
"me011"::	how much each person  spoke.::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Yes,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	very  true - very true  it would be good to normalize with respect to that. Now on the table I did::	0
"me011"::	Normalized to how much -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah::	0
"fe008"::	take one step toward, uh   away  from the raw frequencies by putting,::	0
"fe008"::	uh   percentages.  So that the percentage of time::	0
"fe008"::	of the - of the times that a person spoke,::	0
"fe008"::	what percentage::	0
"fe008"::	eh, w- so.::	1
"fe008"::	Of the times a person spoke  and  furthermore was involved in a two- two-person overlap,::	0
"fe008"::	what percentage of the time were they the  overlapper  and what percent of the time were they th- the  overlappee?::	1
"fe008"::	And  there,  it looks like you see some  differences,::	0
"fe008"::	um,::	1
"fe008"::	that some people tend to be overlapped::	0
"fe008"::	with  more often than they're  overlapped,  but, of course,::	1
"fe008"::	uh i- e-  this is just  one  meeting,::	0
"fe008"::	uh  there's  no  statistical testing involved, and that would be::	0
"fe008"::	required for a - for a  finding   of  any  kind of::	0
"me013"::	S- so, i- it would be  statistically  incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something.::	0
"fe008"::	scientific  reliability.::	1
"me011"::	No - no actually, that would be  actually  statistically  correct,  but::	0
"fe008"::	No, no, no.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, that's right.::	0
"fe008"::	That's right. And I'm  you know, I'm - I don't see a point of singling people out,::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Excuse me.::	0
"fe008"::	now,  this  is a case where obviously -::	0
"me013"::	B- I - I -  I  rather  enjoyed  it, but - but  this::	0
"me018"::	But the numbers speak for themselves.::	0
"mn005"::	He's - Yeah, yeah, yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Well,  you know, it's like - I'm not - I'm not::	0
"me011"::	Yes, that's right, so you don't nee-  O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	saying on the tape who did::	0
"fe008"::	better or worse because  I don't think that it's - I::	0
"me013"::	Sure.::	0
"fe008"::	you know, and - and th- here's a case where of course, human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results,  and - and, so, might as well do this.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, when - this is what -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	This is actually - when Jane sent this email  first,  is what caused me to start  thinking  about::	0
"me011"::	anonymizing  the  data.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, fair enough.  Fair enough.::	0
"fe008"::	And actually,  you know, the point is  not  about an individual, it's the point about  tendencies toward::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	you know, different  styles,  different speaker styles.::	1
"me013"::	Oh  sure.::	0
"fe008"::	And  it would be, you know  of course,::	1
"fe008"::	there's also the question of what type of overlap::	0
"fe008"::	was  this, and w- what were they, and::	1
"fe008"::	i- and I - and I  know  that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the::	1
"fe008"::	general::	0
"fe008"::	cultural idea which w- uh, the  conversation  analysts originally started with in the  seventies  was that we have this  strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th- before you start talking, and::	0
"fe008"::	and you know, I mean,::	0
"fe008"::	w- we know that -::	0
"fe008"::	an- and they've loosened up on that too s- in the intervening time, that::	0
"fe008"::	that that's - that's::	0
"fe008"::	viewed as being::	0
"fe008"::	a culturally- relative  thing, I mean,  that you have the high-involvement style from the East  Coast  where people::	0
"fe008"::	will overlap  often  as an indication of  interest  in what the other person is  saying.::	0
"me011"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"fe008"::	And::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah,  exactly!  Well, there you go. Fine, that's alright, that's O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	Exactly!::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah::	0
"fe008"::	And - and,::	0
"fe008"::	you know, in contrast, so Deborah - d- and also Deborah Tannen's  thesis she talked about differences of these types,  that they're just different  styles,  and it's um::	0
"fe008"::	you - you can't  impose  a model of -::	0
"fe008"::	there - of the ideal being no overlaps, and::	0
"fe008"::	you know, conversational analysts  also  agree with that, so it's::	0
"fe008"::	now, universally::	0
"fe008"::	a- ag-  agreed  with.::	0
"fe008"::	And - and, als- I mean,::	0
"fe008"::	I can't  say  universally,::	0
"fe008"::	but anyway, the people who used to say it was strict,::	0
"fe008"::	um  now, uh::	0
"fe008"::	don't.  I mean they - they   also::	0
"fe008"::	you know, uh  uh,::	0
"fe008"::	ack- acknowledge the influence of::	0
"fe008"::	sub- of subcultural norms and::	0
"fe008"::	cross-cultural norms and things.::	0
"fe008"::	So, um::	1
"fe008"::	Then it beco-::	0
"fe008"::	though - so - just - just superficially to give::	0
"fe008"::	um  a couple ideas of the  types  of overlaps involved, I have at the bottom several that  I  noticed. So,::	1
"fe008"::	uh, there are backchannels, like what Adam just did now and, um::	1
"fe008"::	um, anticipating the end of a  question::	0
"fe008"::	and  simply answering it earlier, and there are several of those in this - in these data where -::	1
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	because we're::	0
"fe008"::	people who've talked to each other,::	0
"fe008"::	um  we know::	0
"fe008"::	basically what the topic is, what the possibilities are and w- and we've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person's  style  is likely to be and so::	0
"fe008"::	and t- there are a number of places where someone just answered  early.::	0
"fe008"::	No problem.::	0
"fe008"::	And places  also::	1
"fe008"::	which I thought were interesting, where two or  more  people gave exactly th- the same answer in unison - different words of course but you know, the - basically,::	1
"fe008"::	you know::	0
"fe008"::	everyone's saying "yes" or - you know, or::	0
"fe008"::	ev- even more sp-  specific  than that.::	0
"fe008"::	So, uh, the point is that, um::	1
"fe008"::	overlap's not necessarily a bad  thing  and that it would be im-::	0
"fe008"::	i- useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved.::	1
"fe008"::	And that's all I wanted to say on that,::	0
"fe008"::	unless  people have questions.::	0
"me013"::	Well, of course th- the biggest,  um::	1
"me013"::	result here, which is one we've -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	we've talked about many times and isn't  new  to us, but which I think would be interesting to show someone who  isn't  familiar with this::	0
"me013"::	is just the sheer number of  overlaps.::	1
"mn005"::	Yes, yes!::	0
"fe008"::	Oh, O_K - interesting.::	0
"me013"::	That - that -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"me013"::	that - that, um::	0
"me013"::	here's a relatively short meeting, it's a forty -::	1
"me013"::	forty plus minute::	0
"me011"::	Hundred ninety-seven.::	0
"me013"::	meeting, and  not  only were there two hundred and fifteen  overlaps::	1
"me013"::	but,::	0
"me013"::	uh::	0
"me013"::	I think there's one -::	0
"me013"::	one minute there where there - where - where there wasn't any overlap? I mean, it's -::	1
"me011"::	S- n- are -::	0
"me013"::	uh throughout this thing?::	0
"fe008"::	Well, at the bottom, you have the bottom three.::	0
"me013"::	It's -::	0
"me018"::	It'd be interesting -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	So four - four minutes all together with  none   - none.::	0
"me013"::	You have -::	0
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	Oh, so the bottom three  did  have s- stuff going on?::	0
"me018"::	But it w-::	0
"fe008"::	Yes, uh-huh. Yeah. But just no overlaps.::	0
"me013"::	There  was  speech?::	0
"me013"::	O_K, so  if - the - this  -::	0
"me018"::	It'd be  interesting  to see what the total amount of  time  is in the overlaps,::	1
"me018"::	versus -::	1
"fe008"::	Yes, exactly and that's - that's where Jose's  pro-   project comes in.::	0
"mn017"::	I was about to ask -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	I h- I have this- that infor- I have th- that information::	0
"fe016"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	now.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, about how much  is  it?::	0
"mn005"::	The - the  duration  of eh - of each of the overlaps.::	0
"me013"::	O- oh, what's - what's the - what's the average::	0
"me013"::	length?::	0
"mn005"::	M- I - I haven't averaged it now but, uh  I - I will, uh::	1
"me013"::	You don't know?::	0
"mn005"::	I will do the - the study of the -  with the - with the program with the - uh, the different, uh  the, nnn,  distribution of the duration of the overlaps.::	1
"me013"::	O_K, you - you don- you don't have a feeling for roughly how  much it is? Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	mmm,  Because the - the uh,  @@  is  @@ .::	0
"mn005"::	The duration is, uh  the variation - the variation of the duration is uh, very big::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	on the dat-::	1
"fe008"::	I suspect that it will also differ,::	0
"mn005"::	but eh -::	0
"fe008"::	depending on the  type  of overlap  involved.  So backchannels will be very brief and -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Oh,  I'm sure.::	0
"mn005"::	Because, on your  surface  eh  a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration::	0
"mn005"::	eh,  overlapped  and another very very short.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Uh, i- probably it's very difficult to - to - because the - the overlap is, uh on- is only the - in the final "S_"::	0
"mn005"::	of the - of the - the fin- the - the end - the end word of the, um  previous speaker::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	with the - the next word of the - the new speaker.::	0
"mn005"::	Um, I considered  that's an overlap but it's very short, it's an "X_" with a -::	0
"mn005"::	and - the idea is probably, eh  when eh - when eh, we studied th- th- that zone, eh::	0
"mn005"::	eh, we h- we have eh eh  confusion with eh eh noise.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	With eh  that  fricative  sounds, but uh  I have  new  information but I have to - to  study .::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, but I - I'd -::	0
"mn017"::	Can I -::	0
"me013"::	u-   go ahead .::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	You split this by minute, um  so if an overlap::	0
"fe008"::	Yes.::	0
"mn017"::	straddles  the boundary between two minutes, that counts towards  both  of those minutes.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Actually, um::	0
"fe008"::	um  actually  not.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh, so  le- let's think about the case where::	1
"fe008"::	A_ starts speaking::	0
"fe008"::	and then B_ overlaps with A_,::	0
"fe008"::	and then the minute boundary happens.::	1
"fe008"::	And let's say that::	1
"fe008"::	after that minute boundary,::	0
"fe008"::	um  B_ is still speaking,::	0
"fe008"::	and A_ overlaps::	0
"fe008"::	with B_,::	1
"fe008"::	that would be a new overlap.::	1
"fe008"::	But  otherwise::	1
"fe008"::	um, let's say B_::	0
"fe008"::	comes to the conclusion of - of that turn without::	0
"fe008"::	anyone overlapping with him or her,::	1
"fe008"::	in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute.::	1
"mn017"::	No, but suppose they both::	0
"mn017"::	talk simultaneously::	0
"mn017"::	both a - a  portion  of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K. In that case, um::	0
"fe008"::	my c-::	0
"fe008"::	the coding that I was using -::	0
"fe008"::	since we haven't,  uh  incorporated Adam's, uh  coding of overlap  yets,   the coding of::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, "yets" is not a word.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh::	0
"fe008"::	since we haven't incorporated Adam's method of handling overl- overlaps yet::	0
"fe008"::	um  then  that would have fallen through the cra- cracks. It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because, um  I wou- I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was::	0
"fe008"::	encoded so far.::	0
"fe008"::	We just haven't done th- the precise second to sec- you know,::	1
"me013"::	I- I-::	0
"fe008"::	second to second coding of  when  they occur.::	1
"me013"::	I- I-::	0
"me013"::	I'm - I'm - I'm confused now. So l- l- let me restate what I  thought  Andreas was saying and - and see.::	0
"fe008"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me013"::	Let's say that in - in second fifty-seven::	0
"fe008"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	of one minute,::	0
"me013"::	you start talking and I start talking::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	and  we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	So we go over - So we were - we were  talking  over one another,::	0
"me013"::	and it's just -::	0
"me013"::	in  each  case, it's just sort of one  interval.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"me013"::	So, um  we talked  over  the minute boundary.::	1
"me013"::	Is this  considered as one overlap in each of the minutes, the way you have  done  this.::	1
"fe008"::	No,  it  wouldn't.::	1
"fe008"::	It would be considered as an overlap in the  first  one.::	1
"me013"::	O_K, so that's::	0
"me013"::	good,  i- I think, in the sense that I think Andreas  meant  the question, right?::	0
"fe016"::	That's -  that's good, yeah, cuz the overall rate is -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	@@::	0
"me011"::	Statistical.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm. Yeah. They're  not  double  counted.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	Other- otherwise you'd get  double  counts, here and there.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Ah but,::	0
"fe016"::	yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	@@::	0
"mn017"::	And then it would be  harder  -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	I should also say I did a simplifying, uh  count in that::	0
"fe008"::	if A_ was speaking::	0
"fe008"::	B_ overlapped with A_ and then A_ came  back  again and overlapped with  B_  again,::	0
"fe008"::	I - I didn't count that as a  three-person  overlap, I counted that as a  two-person  overlap,::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	and it was  A_  being overlapped with by  D_ .::	0
"fe008"::	Because the idea was the  first  speaker::	0
"fe008"::	had the floor::	0
"fe008"::	and the  second  person::	0
"fe008"::	started speaking and then the f- the first person reasserted the floor  kind of thing.::	0
"fe008"::	These are simplifying assumptions, didn't happen very often, there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I want to go back and listen to minute forty-one.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Cuz i- i- I find it  interesting  that there were a large number of  overlaps  and they were  all   two-speaker.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	I mean what I  thought  - what I::	0
"me011"::	would have  thought  in::	0
"fe008"::	That's interesting.::	0
"me011"::	is that when there were a  large  number of  overlaps,  it was because  everyone  was talking at  once,::	0
"fe008"::	That's  interesting.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	but uh::	0
"me011"::	apparently  not.  That's really  neat.::	0
"mn005"::	Mmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, there's a lot of backchannel, a lot o- a lot of -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	This  is  really interesting data.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, it  is.  I think so too, I think -::	0
"fe016"::	I  think  what's really interesting though, it is::	0
"fe016"::	before d-::	0
"fe016"::	saying " yes,  meetings have a lot of  overlaps " is to actually::	0
"fe016"::	find out  how  many  more::	0
"fe016"::	we have than  two-party.::	0
"fe016"::	Cuz in  two-party  conversations, like  Switchboard,  there's an  awful  lot too if you just look at::	0
"fe016"::	backchannels,  if you consider those overlaps?::	0
"fe016"::	it's also ver- it's huge.::	0
"fe016"::	It's just that people haven't been::	0
"fe016"::	looking  at that because they've been doing  single-channel  processing for::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"fe016"::	speech  recognition.::	0
"fe016"::	So, the question is, you know, how many more overlaps::	1
"fe016"::	do you  have::	0
"fe016"::	of, say the  two-person  type, by adding more  people.::	0
"fe016"::	to a  meeting,::	1
"fe016"::	and it  may  be a lot more but i- it may -::	0
"fe016"::	it may  not  be.::	0
"me013"::	Well, but see, I find it interesting even if it  wasn't  any more,::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	because::	0
"me013"::	since we  were  dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated  out::	0
"me013"::	we just - everything was just  nice,  so that - so the issue is in - in a situation::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"fe016"::	Well, it's  not  really  " nice ".::	0
"me013"::	where th- that's -::	0
"fe016"::	It depends what you're  doing.::	0
"fe016"::	So if you were actually::	0
"fe016"::	having, uh -::	0
"fe016"::	depends what you're doing,::	0
"fe016"::	if -::	0
"fe016"::	Right now we're do- we have  individual   mikes on the people in this meeting.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"fe016"::	So the question is, you know -::	0
"fe016"::	"are there really more overlaps  happening::	0
"fe016"::	than there would be in a  two-person    party ".::	0
"me013"::	Let -::	0
"me013"::	let m-::	0
"fe016"::	And - and there well may  be,  but -::	0
"me013"::	let me rephrase what I'm saying::	0
"me013"::	cuz I don't think I'm getting it across.::	0
"me013"::	What -::	0
"me013"::	what I - what -::	0
"me013"::	I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that's too - i- too imprecise.::	0
"me013"::	But what I  mean  is::	1
"me013"::	that, um  in   Switchboard,::	0
"me013"::	despite the many -  many  other problems that we have, one problem that we're  not  considering is overlap.::	1
"me013"::	And what we're doing  now  is,::	1
"me013"::	aside from the many  other  differences in the  task,  we  are  considering overlap::	1
"me013"::	and  one  of the reasons that we're  considering  it,::	1
"me013"::	you know,  one  of them::	0
"me013"::	not  all  of them,  one  of them  is::	0
"me013"::	that w- uh at least,::	0
"me013"::	you know  I'm  very interested in::	0
"me013"::	the scenario in which, uh::	0
"me013"::	both people talking are pretty much equally   audible,::	0
"me013"::	and from a single  microphone.::	1
"me013"::	And so,::	1
"me013"::	in that case, it  does  get mixed in,::	0
"me013"::	and it's pretty hard to jus-::	0
"me013"::	to just  ignore  it, to just do processing on  one  and not on the  other.::	1
"fe016"::	I - I agree that it's an issue here::	1
"fe016"::	but it's  also  an issue for  Switchboard  and if you::	1
"fe016"::	think of meetings::	0
"fe016"::	being recorded over the telephone, which I think,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	you know, this  whole   point  of  studying   meetings  isn't just to have people in a  room  but to also have::	0
"fe016"::	meetings  over different  phone  lines.::	0
"fe016"::	Maybe far field  mike  people wouldn't be interested in that but all the  dialogue  issues still apply,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	so if each of us was calling and having::	0
"fe016"::	a meeting  that  way::	0
"fe016"::	you kn- you know like a  conference  call.::	0
"fe016"::	And, just the question is,::	0
"fe016"::	y- you know, in  Switchboard::	0
"fe016"::	you would  think  that's the  simplest   case  of a  meeting::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	of more than one person, and::	0
"fe016"::	I'm  wondering  how much more  overlap::	0
"fe016"::	of::	0
"fe016"::	the types that - that Jane  described  happen with more  people  present.::	1
"fe016"::	So it may be that having  three  people::	0
"fe016"::	is  very  different from having two people or it may  not  be.::	1
"me013"::	That's an  important  question to ask. I think what I'm -::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	All I'm s- really saying is that I don't think we were  considering  that in Switchboard.::	0
"fe016"::	Not you,  me.::	0
"fe016"::	But uh -::	0
"me013"::	Were you?::	0
"me011"::	Though it wasn't   in  the  design.::	0
"fe016"::	but -::	0
"fe016"::	but::	0
"me013"::	Were you - were you - were you - were you measuring it?::	0
"me013"::	I mean, w- w- were -::	0
"fe016"::	There - there's::	0
"fe016"::	actually::	0
"fe016"::	to tell you the truth, the reason why it's hard to measure is because::	0
"fe016"::	of::	0
"fe016"::	so, from the point of view of studying  dialogue,  I mean, which  Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on,::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	you want to know the  sequence  of turns.::	1
"fe016"::	So what happens is if  you're  talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn,::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	and then you keep going::	0
"fe016"::	what it  looks  like in a dialogue model is  your  turn and then my  backchannel,::	1
"fe016"::	even though my backchannel occurred completely  inside  your turn.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah?::	0
"fe016"::	So, for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling::	1
"fe016"::	it's -::	0
"fe016"::	We  know  that that's  wrong::	0
"me013"::	Yeah?::	0
"fe016"::	in real time.::	1
"fe016"::	But,  because::	1
"fe016"::	of::	0
"fe016"::	the  acoustic   segmentations  that were done and the fact that  some  of the acoustic data in  Switchboard  were  missing,::	0
"fe016"::	people couldn't  study  it,::	0
"fe016"::	but that doesn't mean in the real  world  that people don't  talk  that way.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah, I wasn't  saying  that.::	0
"fe016"::	So,::	0
"me013"::	Right? I was just saying that w-  now  we're  looking  at it.::	0
"fe016"::	it's -::	0
"fe016"::	um::	0
"me013"::	And - and - and, you - you maybe  wanted  to look at it before but, for these various technical reasons in terms of how the  data  was you  weren't.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, we've als-::	0
"fe016"::	Right. We're  looking  at it  here.::	0
"me013"::	So that's why it's coming to us as  new::	0
"me013"::	even though it may well  be::	0
"me013"::	you know, if your - if your hypothes- The hypothesis you were offering::	0
"fe016"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	eh - Right? -::	0
"me013"::	if it's the  null  poth-  hypothesis,::	0
"me013"::	and if actually you have as  much  overlap in a two-person,::	0
"me013"::	we  don't  know the  answer  to that.::	0
"me013"::	The reason we  don't  know the  answer  to is cuz it wasn't  studied::	0
"me013"::	and it wasn't  studied  because it wasn't set  up.   Right?::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, all I meant is::	0
"fe016"::	that::	0
"fe016"::	if you're asking the question from the point of view of::	0
"fe016"::	what's different about a  meeting,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"fe016"::	studying  meetings  of, say, more than two  people  versus::	0
"fe016"::	what::	0
"fe016"::	kinds of questions you could ask with a  two-person   meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	It's  important   to distinguish::	1
"fe016"::	that, you know, this project::	0
"fe016"::	is getting a lot of overlap::	0
"fe016"::	but  other  projects were too,::	0
"fe016"::	but we just couldn't  study  them.::	1
"me013"::	May  have been.::	0
"fe016"::	And  and so uh::	0
"me013"::	May  have been. Right?::	0
"me013"::	We do kn- we don't know the numbers.::	0
"fe016"::	Well,::	0
"fe016"::	there  is  a high  rate,::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"fe016"::	It's - but I don't know  how  high,::	0
"fe016"::	in fact::	0
"me018"::	Well, here-::	0
"me018"::	I  have a question.::	0
"fe016"::	that would be::	0
"me013"::	See, I mean, i- i- le- let me t-::	0
"fe016"::	interesting to know.::	0
"me013"::	I mean, my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody, " what  have we learned about  overlaps  here?"::	0
"me013"::	just never mind comparison with something else,::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	what we've learned about is  overlaps  in this situation, is that - the first -::	1
"me013"::	the  first-order  thing I would say is that there's a  lot  of them.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"me013"::	In - in the sense that i- if you said::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah,::	0
"me013"::	if - i- i- i-::	0
"fe016"::	I - I don't di-::	0
"me013"::	In a way, I guess what I'm comparing to is more the::	0
"fe016"::	I::	0
"fe016"::	agree with::	0
"fe016"::	that.::	0
"me013"::	common  sense  notion of::	0
"me013"::	how - how much people  overlap.::	0
"me013"::	Uh  you know the fact that when - when - when, uh, Adam was looking for a stretch of - of speech before, that didn't have any overlaps, and he w- he was having such a hard time::	0
"me013"::	and now I look at  this  and I go, "well, I can  see  why he was having such a hard time". It's  happening  a  lot.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	That's also true of  Switchboard.::	0
"fe016"::	It may not be -::	0
"me013"::	I wasn't saying it  wasn't.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.  So it's just,::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"fe016"::	um::	0
"me013"::	I was commenting about  this.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	I'm saying if  I  -::	0
"fe016"::	All I'm saying is that from the::	0
"me013"::	I'm saying if I  have  this complicated thing in  front  of me,::	0
"me013"::	and we sh- which,  you know we're gonna get::	0
"me013"::	much  more sophisticated about when we get  lots  more  data,::	0
"me013"::	But - Then, if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn::	0
"me013"::	right here, about, you know, the - the modest amount of data that was  analyzed  I'd say, "Well, the  first-order   thing  was there was a  lot  of  overlaps ".::	0
"me013"::	In fact -::	1
"me013"::	and it's  not  just an overlap -::	0
"me013"::	bunch of overlaps -  second-order  thing is::	0
"me013"::	it's  not  just a bunch of overlaps in  one  particular  point,::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"me013"::	but that there's overlaps, uh  throughout  the thing.::	1
"me013"::	And that's  interesting.    That's  all.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	No, I - I agree with that.::	0
"fe016"::	I'm just::	0
"fe016"::	saying that it may -::	0
"fe016"::	the  reason  you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the  number  of people in the meeting.::	0
"me013"::	Oh  yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	And::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, I wasn't making any  statement  about  that.::	0
"fe016"::	that's all.::	0
"fe016"::	And - and it would actually be interesting to find  out  because::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	some of the::	0
"fe016"::	data say Switchboard, which isn't exactly the same kind of context, I mean these are two people who  don't  know each other and so forth,::	0
"fe016"::	But we should  still  be able to::	1
"fe016"::	somehow::	0
"fe016"::	say what - what is the  added   contra- contribution to sort of overlap::	0
"fe016"::	time::	0
"fe016"::	of each additional person, or something like that.::	1
"me011"::	Yep. I could  certainly   see  it going  either   way.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, now.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, that would be good to know, but w- we -::	0
"me018"::	What -::	0
"fe008"::	Wh- yeah, I - I agree - I agree with Adam. And the reason is because I think there's a limit -::	0
"fe016"::	But yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	there's an upper  bound::	0
"fe008"::	on how many you can have,  simply::	0
"fe008"::	from the standpoint of  audibility.  When we  speak  we - we  do  make a judgment of::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	"can -"::	0
"fe008"::	you know, as  adults.   I mean, children don't  adjust  so well,::	0
"fe008"::	I mean, if a truck::	1
"fe008"::	goes rolling past,::	0
"fe008"::	adults will::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	well, depending, but  mostly,  adults will - will -::	0
"fe008"::	will hold off to what -::	0
"fe008"::	to finish the end of the sentence till the - till the  noise  is past. And I think we generally  do::	1
"fe008"::	monitor  things like that,::	0
"fe008"::	about - whether we - whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.::	1
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	And partly it's related to  rhythmic  structure in conversation, so,::	1
"fe008"::	you know, you - you t-::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, this is d- also um,::	0
"fe008"::	people  tend  to  time  their - their -::	0
"me018"::	Well -::	0
"fe008"::	their, um::	0
"fe008"::	when they  come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic,  uh::	0
"fe016"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	uh, ambient thing.::	0
"fe008"::	So you  don't  want to be c- cross-cutting.::	0
"fe008"::	And -::	1
"fe008"::	and, just to finish this,::	0
"fe008"::	that um::	0
"fe008"::	That I think that::	0
"fe008"::	there may be an upper bound on  how  many overlaps you can have,  simply  from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already::	0
"fe008"::	in the::	0
"fe008"::	fray.::	1
"fe008"::	But I - you know,::	0
"fe008"::	of certain  types.::	1
"fe008"::	Now if it's just  backchannels,::	0
"fe008"::	people::	0
"fe008"::	may be doing  that::	0
"fe008"::	with less   intention  of being heard,::	0
"fe008"::	just sort of spontaneously doing  backchannels,::	1
"fe008"::	in which case::	1
"fe008"::	that -  those  might -::	0
"fe008"::	there may be  no  upper bound on  those.::	1
"mn017"::	I - I have a  feeling  that backchannels, which are::	0
"mn017"::	the vast majority of overlaps in  Switchboard,::	0
"mn017"::	uh, don't play as big a role  here,  because it's very  unnatural::	0
"mn017"::	I think, to backchannel if - in a multi-audience -::	0
"mn017"::	you know, in a multi-person::	0
"fe016"::	If you can  see  them, actually.::	0
"mn017"::	audience.::	0
"fe016"::	It's interesting, so if you watch people are going like -::	0
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	Right  - right, like this  here,  but::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	u-::	0
"fe016"::	That may not be the case if you couldn't see them.::	0
"mn017"::	But -::	0
"mn017"::	but, it's sort of odd if one person's speaking and everybody's listening, and::	0
"mn017"::	it's unusual to have everybody going "uh-huh, uh-huh"::	0
"me013"::	Actually,  I  think I've done it::	0
"me013"::	a  fair  number of times today.  @@  But.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	There's a lot of  head-nodding,::	0
"me011"::	Um.::	0
"fe016"::	in this::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yep, we need to put  trackers  on it.::	0

"fe008"::	He  could,  he could.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah. So - so actually, um::	1
"mn017"::	That's in part because the  nodding,  if you have  visual  contact,::	0
"mn017"::	the nodding has the same  function,  but on the  phone,  in  Switchboard::	1
"mn017"::	you - you - that wouldn't  work.  So::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, you don't have it.::	0
"mn017"::	so you  need  to use the  backchannel.::	0
"me011"::	Your mike is -::	0

"me018"::	when there's  backchannel,::	0

"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Thank you.::	0
"fe008"::	E- for example.::	0

"fe016"::	Oh.::	0
"me018"::	I was just  listening,  and -::	0
"me018"::	and when there's  two  people talking and there's  backchannel  it seems like,::	0
"me018"::	um the  backchannel   happens  when, you know, the  pitch  drops and the first person -::	1
"me018"::	and a  lot  of times, the first person actually  stops  talking and then there's a backchannel::	0
"me018"::	and then they start  up  again, and so I'm wondering about -::	0
"me018"::	h-::	0
"me018"::	I just wonder how much overlap there is.::	0
"me018"::	Is there a lot?::	0
"fe016"::	I  think  there's a  lot  of the kind that  Jose  was talking about, where -::	1
"fe016"::	I mean, this is called "precision timing" in  conversation analysis,::	0
"fe016"::	where::	0
"fe016"::	they come in::	0
"fe016"::	overlapping,::	0
"fe016"::	but at a point where::	0
"fe016"::	the::	0
"fe016"::	information is mostly::	0
"fe016"::	complete.::	1
"fe016"::	So all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words.::	1
"me018"::	Mmm.::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	So  technically,  it's an overlap.::	1
"fe016"::	But::	1
"me018"::	But maybe a - just a  small  overlap?::	0
"fe016"::	you know, from  information  flow point of view it's not an overlap in  the predictable information.::	1
"mn005"::	More, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	It'd be  interesting  if we could do  prediction.::	0
"me018"::	I was just thinking more in terms of  alignment,::	0
"me018"::	alignment  overlap.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Language  model prediction of  overlap,  that would be  really   interesting.::	1
"mn017"::	So -  so -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, that's  exactly,   exactly   why  we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins- in::	1
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe016"::	uh  Switchboard,  say, because there's a lot of that.::	1
"mn017"::	So - so  here's  a - here's a first interesting   labeling  task.::	1
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh, to distinguish between, say,  backchannels::	1
"mn017"::	precision timing - Sort of::	0
"mn017"::	you know,  benevolent  overlaps,::	0
"mn017"::	and - and -::	0
"mn017"::	and w- and -::	0
"me011"::	Let's pick a different word.::	0
"mn017"::	and sort of, um  I don't know,  hostile  overlaps, where::	0
"mn017"::	someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Uh,  that  - that might be an  interesting,  um   problem  to  look  at.::	0
"me018"::	Hostile takeovers.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, I mean you could do that. I ju- I - I think that::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	in this meeting I  really  had the feeling that wasn't happening, that::	0
"fe008"::	the hostile - hostile type.::	0
"fe008"::	These were - these were::	1
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	benevolent types, as people::	0
"fe016"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	finishing each other's sentences, and::	0
"mn017"::	Um, I could imagine that as - there's a fair number of::	0
"fe008"::	stuff.::	1
"mn017"::	um::	0
"mn017"::	cases where,::	0
"mn017"::	and this is sort of, not  really  hostile,  but sort of  competitive,  where::	0
"mn017"::	one  person is  finishing  something and::	0
"mn017"::	you have, like,  two  or  three  people jumping - trying to -::	0
"me011"::	Trying to  get  the floor.::	0
"mn017"::	trying to -::	0
"mn017"::	trying to, uh  grab  the next  turn.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	And so it's  not  against the person who talks  first::	0
"mn017"::	because actually we're all  waiting  for that person to  finish.::	0
"mn017"::	But they  all  want to  be  next.::	0
"me013"::	I have a  feeling  most of these things are - that -::	1
"me013"::	that are not::	0
"me013"::	a benevolent kind are - are::	0
"me013"::	are, uh::	0
"me013"::	um::	0
"me013"::	are - are  competitive  as opposed to real- really -  really  hostile. But.::	1
"mn017"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, I agree. I agree.::	0
"me018"::	I wonder what determines who  gets  the floor?::	0
"fe008"::	Well, there are  various  things, you - you have the -::	0
"me018"::	I mean -::	0
"me013"::	Uh a vote - vote in Florida.  Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	It's been studied a  lot.::	0
"mn005"::	Voting for -::	0
"me013"::	Um, o- one thing - I - I wanted to -::	0
"me013"::	or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to g- break in. But. But.::	0
"mn017"::	Seniority.::	0
"me013"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	You know, the  other  thing I was thinking was that,  um  these -::	1
"me013"::	all  these interesting  questions  are, of course, pretty  hard  to  answer  with, uh u-::	0
"me013"::	you know, a small amount of  data.::	1
"me013"::	@@::	0
"me011"::	Ach.::	0
"me013"::	So, um  I  wonder  if what you're saying::	0
"me013"::	suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have,::	0
"me013"::	um::	0
"me013"::	a - a fair number of meetings::	0
"me013"::	with, uh::	0
"me013"::	a  smaller  number of people.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"me013"::	I mean::	1
"me013"::	we - most of our meetings are::	0
"me013"::	uh, meetings currently with say five, six, seven, eight people::	1
"me013"::	Should we::	1
"me013"::	really  try to  have  some two-person meetings,  or some three-person meetings and re- record them::	0
"me013"::	just to - to - to::	0
"me013"::	beef up the - the  statistics  on that?::	1
"fe008"::	That's a control.::	0
"fe008"::	Well,::	0
"fe008"::	it seems like there are  two  possibilities there, I mean::	0
"fe008"::	i- it seems like::	0
"fe008"::	if you have just::	0
"fe008"::	two  people it's not::	0
"fe008"::	really,::	0
"fe008"::	y- like a  meeting,  w-::	0
"fe008"::	is not as  similar  as the rest of the -::	0
"fe008"::	of the  sample.::	0
"fe008"::	It depends on what you're after, of course, but::	0
"fe008"::	It seems like  that  would be more a case of the  control  condition, compared to, uh  an  experimental::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	condition, with  more  than two.::	0
"me013"::	Well, Liz was raising the question of - of whether i- it's the number - there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there,::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	and, um::	0
"me013"::	If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference   also  that you have in the::	0
"me013"::	say, in  Switchboard  data.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Uh::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, I'm just thinking that'd be more like a c-  control  condition.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Well, but from the  acoustic  point of view,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	it's all good.::	0
"mn005"::	Is the same.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah,  acoustic  is fine, but -::	0
"mn017"::	If - if the goal were to  just  look at  overlap  you would -::	1
"mn017"::	you could serve yourself -  save  yourself a lot of  time  but not even transcri- transcribe the  words.::	1
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, I was thinking you  should  be able to do this::	1
"fe016"::	from the   acoustics,  on the  close-talking  mikes, right?::	1
"me011"::	Well, that's - the - that was my - my status report, so::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Right, I mean Adam was -::	0
"fe008"::	You've been  working  on that.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	right. I mean, not as well as what - I mean, you wouldn't be able to have any kind of  typology,  obviously, but::	0
"me011"::	Once we're done with  this  stuff  discussing,::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	you'd get some rough statistics.::	0
"fe016"::	So.::	0
"me013"::	But -::	0
"me013"::	what - what do you think about that?::	0
"me013"::	Do you think that would be useful? I'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two-person meetings or something.::	0
"fe016"::	I guess my - my first comment was, um  only that::	1
"fe016"::	um::	0
"fe016"::	we should n- not attribute  overlaps  only to meetings, but maybe that's obvious, maybe::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	everybody knew that, but that::	1
"fe016"::	in normal::	0
"fe016"::	conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap, and that it would be interesting::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	to::	0
"fe016"::	look at  whether there  are  these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned, that::	0
"fe016"::	what maybe the  additional  people add to this competition that happens  right  after a turn,::	1
"fe016"::	you know, because now you can have  five  people trying to grab the turn, but pretty quickly::	0
"fe016"::	there're - they back  off  and you go back to this sort of::	0
"fe016"::	only one person at a time with one person::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	interrupting at a time.::	0
"fe016"::	So, I don't know. To answer your question I  it - I don't think it's::	1
"fe016"::	crucial to have::	0
"fe016"::	controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we::	1
"me011"::	Can.::	0
"fe016"::	can.::	1
"me013"::	Well,  O_K.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	So, um::	0
"mn017"::	I  -  I  have an idea.::	0
"fe016"::	you know.::	0
"fe016"::	D- I wouldn't  not  record a two-person meeting just because it only has two people.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn017"::	Could we -::	0
"mn017"::	Could we, um -::	0
"mn017"::	we have - have in the  past  and I think  continue  - will  continue  to have a fair number of  uh  phone  conference calls.::	1
"me013"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, we  talked  about this repeatedly.::	0
"mn017"::	And,::	1
"mn017"::	uh,::	0
"mn017"::	and as a -::	0
"mn017"::	to, um::	0
"mn017"::	as another c-  c-  comparison   condition,  we could::	0
"mn017"::	um::	0
"mn017"::	see what - what::	0
"mn017"::	what  happens  in terms of  overlap,  when you  don't  have visual contact.::	1
"mn017"::	So, um -::	0
"fe016"::	Can we actually record?::	0
"me011"::	It just seems like that's a very  different   thing than what we're doing.::	0
"me013"::	Uh::	0
"fe016"::	I mean   physically   can we  record  the o- the other -::	0
"me013"::	Well, we'll have to set  up  for it.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Well, we're not really set up for it::	1
"me013"::	to do that.::	1
"me013"::	But.::	0
"mn017"::	Or,::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	this is getting a little  extravagant,::	0
"mn017"::	we could put up::	0
"mn017"::	some kind of::	0
"mn017"::	blinds  or something to -::	0
"me011"::	Barriers!::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	to remove, uh::	0
"fe016"::	That's what they  did  on Map Task,::	0
"mn017"::	visual  contact.::	1
"fe016"::	you know, this Map Task corpus?::	0
"fe016"::	They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without::	0
"fe016"::	visual cues and it's quite interesting.::	0
"me013"::	Well, we - we record this meeting so  regularly  it wouldn't be that -::	0
"me013"::	I mean  a little  strange.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, we can  record,  but  no  one can  look  at each other.::	0
"fe016"::	Well, we could just put  b-  blindfolds  on.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	Well y- no you - f- Yeah, Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Close  your eyes.::	0
"fe008"::	Blindf-::	0
"me011"::	Turn off the  lights.::	0
"fe016"::	and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.::	0
"fe016"::	That would -::	0
"me013"::	Oh, th-  that  was the  other  thing, weren't we gonna take a picture::	1
"me013"::	at the beginning of each of these meetings?::	1
"me011"::	Um, what - I had::	1
"me011"::	thought  we were gonna do is just take pictures of the  whiteboards.::	0
"me011"::	rather than take pictures of the  meeting.::	1
"fe008"::	Well, linguistic -::	0
"me011"::	And, uh -::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"fe008"::	Linguistic anthropologists would - would suggest it would be useful to::	0
"me013"::	There's a head nodding here vigorously, yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	also take a picture of the  meeting.::	0
"fe008"::	The -::	1
"me018"::	Why - why do we want to have a picture of the meeting?::	0
"fe016"::	Ee-   you mean, transc-::	0
"mn005"::	@@::	0
"fe008"::	because you get then the  spatial  relationship of the  speakers.::	0
"fe016"::	no -::	0
"mn017"::	Well, you could do that by just  noting  on the  enrollment  sheet the -::	1
"fe008"::	And that::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah::	0
"fe008"::	could be::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Seat  number, that's a good idea.::	1
"mn017"::	the  seat  number.::	1
"me011"::	I'll do that. I'll do that on the next set of forms.::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah. Is possible to get information from the  rhythmic  - f- from the  ge- , eh  uh, files.::	0
"mn017"::	So you'd  number  them somehow.::	0
"me011"::	I  finally  remembered to put, uh::	0
"me018"::	We can - can't you figure it out from the  mike  number?::	0
"me011"::	put native language on the  newer  forms.::	0
"me011"::	No.::	0
"me018"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	The  wireless  ones.::	0
"me011"::	And even the  jacks,  I mean, I'm sitting here and the jack is  over  in front of you.::	0
"me018"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	But  probably  from these you could've  infer it.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah, but::	0
"me011"::	It would be another  task.::	0
"mn017"::	It's - it would be trivial -::	0
"fe016"::	It would be a research task.::	0
"me011"::	Having - having ground tu- truth would be  nice,  so   seat  number would be good.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, yeah.::	0
"me018"::	You know where you could get it?::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Beam-forming  during the  digit   uh stuff.::	0
"me011"::	So I'm gonna put little  labels  on all the  chairs  with the  seat  number. That's a good idea.::	1
"mn014"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn017"::	Not the  chairs.  The  chairs  are -::	0
"fe016"::	But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla- like here.::	0
"me011"::	But, uh -::	0
"mn017"::	Chairs  are  movable.::	1
"mn017"::	Put them -::	0
"mn005"::	The chair-::	0
"mn017"::	Like,  put them on the  table  where they -::	1
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	But you know, they - the - s-::	0
"fe008"::	the linguistic  anthropologists  would say it would be good to have a digital picture  anyway,  because you get::	0
"me018"::	Just  remembered a  joke.::	0
"fe008"::	a sense also of  posture.::	0
"fe008"::	Posture, and we could like,::	0
"mn017"::	What people were  wearing.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	you know,::	0
"fe008"::	block out the person's  face  or whatever but -::	0
"fe016"::	The fashion statement.::	0
"fe008"::	but, you know,  these  are  important  cues, I mean the -::	0
"mn017"::	Oh,  Andreas  was -::	0
"me018"::	How big their  heads  are.::	0
"fe008"::	the -::	0
"fe008"::	how a person is sitting  is -::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	But if you just f-::	0
"mn017"::	Andreas  was  wearing  that  same  old  sweater  again.::	0
"me013"::	But from one picture, I don't know that you really get that. Right?::	0
"me013"::	You'd want a video for that, I think.::	0
"fe008"::	It'd be better than  nothing,  is - is -::	0
"mn005"::	A video, yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	i- Just from a  single  picture I think you can tell  some  aspects.::	0
"me013"::	Think so?::	0
"fe008"::	I mean I - I could  tell  you I mean, if I- if I'm in certain  meetings  I notice that there are certain people who::	0
"mn017"::	And -::	0
"mn017"::	And -::	0
"fe008"::	really do -::	0
"fe008"::	eh -::	0
"fe008"::	The body language is very uh -::	0
"me013"::	Hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	And - and::	0
"mn017"::	Morgan  had that  funny   hair  again.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, I mean you black out the -  that  part. But it's just, you know, the - the body::	0
"me011"::	Hmm.::	0
"me018"::	He agreed.::	0
"fe008"::	you know?::	0
"me011"::	Of course, the -  where  we sit at the  table,  I find is  very   interesting,  that we do tend to  cong-  to::	0
"me011"::	gravitate  to the  same   place  each  time.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	and it's  somewhat   coincidental.  I'm sitting  here  so that I can::	0
"me011"::	run into the  room  if the  hardware  starts, you know,  catching   fire  or  something.::	0
"mn017"::	Oh, no, you - you just like to be in  charge,  that's why you're sitting -::	0
"me011"::	I just want to be at the  head  of the  table.::	0
"mn017"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Take control.::	0
"me013"::	Speaking  of taking  control,  you said you had some research  to talk about .::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, I've been playing with, um::	1
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	uh, using the  close-talking  mike to do - to  try  to figure out who's  speaking.::	1
"me011"::	So my  first  attempt was just using thresholding and  filtering,  that we talked about - about two weeks ago,::	1
"me011"::	and so I played with that a little bit, and::	0
"me011"::	it works O_ K,   except that::	0
"me011"::	it's  very  sensitive to your choice of::	0
"me011"::	your filter width and your::	0
"me011"::	threshold.::	0
"me011"::	So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not.::	1
"me011"::	But if you try to use the same parameters on another  speaker,  it doesn't work anymore,  even if you normalize it based on::	1
"me011"::	the absolute  loudness.::	1
"fe016"::	But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole  meeting?::	0
"me011"::	It  does  work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.::	1
"me011"::	Um::	0
"me011"::	Pretty  well.  Pretty  well.::	0
"me018"::	How did you do it Adam?::	0
"me011"::	How  did I  do  it? What do you mean?::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	I mean, wh- what was the -::	0
"me011"::	The algorithm was, uh::	1
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	take::	0
"me011"::	o- every frame that's over the threshold,::	0
"me011"::	and then median-filter it,::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	and then look for runs.::	1
"me011"::	So there was a  minimum  run length, so that -::	1
"me018"::	Every frame that's over  what  threshold?::	0
"me011"::	A  threshold  that you  pick.::	0
"me018"::	In terms of  energy?::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	Ah!::	0
"me018"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	Say that again?::	0
"fe008"::	Frame over fres- threshold.::	0
"me011"::	So you take a - each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to  one,  and if it's under the threshold you set it to  zero,::	1
"fe008"::	Hmm.::	0
"me011"::	so now you have a  bit  stream  of zeros and ones.::	1
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	And then I  median - filtered  that::	1
"me011"::	using, um  a fairly long  filter length.::	1
"me011"::	Uh  well, actually I guess depends on what you mean by  long,  you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers.::	1
"me011"::	Um::	1
"me011"::	and that's to average out::	0
"me011"::	you know,  pitch,::	0
"me011"::	you know, the  pitch  contours,::	0
"me011"::	and things like that.::	1
"me011"::	And then, uh::	1
"me011"::	looked for long runs.::	1
"fe008"::	O_K::	0
"me011"::	And that works O_ K,  if you fil- if you tune the filter parameters, if you tune  how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds.::	1
"me018"::	Did you ever try running the filter  before  you pick a threshold?::	0
"me011"::	No.::	0
"me011"::	I certainly could though.::	0
"me011"::	But this was just::	0
"me011"::	I  had  the program  mostly  written  already  so it was  easy  to  do.::	0
"me011"::	O_K and then the  other  thing I did, was I took::	1
"me011"::	Javier's  speaker-change  detector - acoustic- change  detector, and I implemented  that  with the close-talking  mikes,::	1
"me011"::	and   unfortunately  that's not working real well, and it looks like it's -::	1
"me011"::	the problem is - he does it in two passes, the first pass::	1
"me011"::	is to find  candidate  places to do a break.::	1
"me011"::	And he does that using a neural net doing broad  phone  classification and he::	1
"me011"::	has the::	0
"me011"::	the, uh   one  of the phone classes is silence.::	1
"me011"::	And so the  possible   breaks  are where  silence  starts and ends.::	0
"me011"::	And then he has a  second  pass which is a modeling - a Gaussian mixture model.::	1
"me011"::	Um::	1
"me011"::	looking for::	0
"me011"::	uh::	0
"me011"::	whether it  improves  or - or  degrades  to split  at  one of those particular places.::	1
"me011"::	And what looks like it's  happening  is that the -::	1
"me011"::	even on the  close-talking  mike::	0
"me011"::	the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job.::	1
"me018"::	Who  was it  trained  on?::	0
"me011"::	Uh, I have no idea. I don't remember.::	0
"me018"::	Hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Does an- do you remember, Morgan, was it Broadcast News?::	0
"me013"::	I think so, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Um::	1
"me011"::	So, at any rate, my  next  attempt,  which I'm in the  midst  of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the::	0
"me011"::	uh,  thresholding::	0
"me011"::	as the way of generating the candidates.::	1
"me011"::	Because one of the things that  definitely   happens  is if you  put  the threshold  low   you get  lots  of breaks.::	0
"me011"::	All  of which are  definitely  acoustic events.::	0
"me011"::	They're  definitely::	0
"me011"::	someone  talking.::	0
"me011"::	But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person  here,  but the person over  there  or it can be the person  breathing.::	0
"me011"::	And then feeding  that  into the acoustic change detector.::	1
"me011"::	And so I think  that  might  work.::	0
"me011"::	But, I haven't gotten very far on that.::	0
"me011"::	But  all  of this is close-talking mike, so::	1
"me011"::	it's, uh  just -  just  trying to get some ground truth.::	0
"mn005"::	Only with eh::	0
"mn005"::	uh, but eh::	0
"mn005"::	I - I - I think, eh::	0
"mn005"::	when - when, y- I -  I saw the - the - the - the speech from P_D_A and, eh  close   talker. I - I think the::	0
"mn005"::	there is a - a great difference in the - in the signal.::	0
"me011"::	Oh,  absolutely.  So  s- my  intention  for  this  is -  is  as an  aide  for ground  truth.::	1
"mn005"::	Um::	0
"mn005"::	but eh I -::	0
"me011"::	not -::	0
"mn005"::	but eh::	0
"mn005"::	I - I - I mean that eh eh  in the - in the mixed file::	0
"mn005"::	you can find, uh  zone with, eh::	0
"mn005"::	great different, eh  level of energy.::	0
"mn005"::	Um::	0
"mn005"::	I - I think for, eh   algorithm based  on energy,::	0
"mn005"::	eh, that um::	0
"mn005"::	h- mmm, - more or less, eh, like eh::	0
"mn005"::	eh, mmm, first sound energy detector.::	0
"me011"::	Say it again?::	0
"mn005"::	eh nnn.::	0
"mn005"::	When y- you the detect the - the - the  first at - at the end  of - of the::	0
"mn005"::	detector of, ehm princ- um. What is the - the name in  English ? the - the, mmm,::	0
"mn005"::	the de- detector of, ehm of a word in the - in the s- in -::	0
"mn005"::	an isolated word::	0
"mn005"::	in - in the  background::	0
"me011"::	I'm - I'm not sure what you're  saying,  can you try -::	0
"mn005"::	That, uh::	0
"mn005"::	I mean that when - when you use, eh  eh   any::	0
"me018"::	I think he's saying the  onset  detector.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Onset detector, O_K.::	0
"mn005"::	I - I think it's probably  to work  well eh, because, eh  you have eh, in the mixed files a  great  level of energy.::	0
"mn005"::	eh  and great difference between the  sp-  speaker.::	0
"mn005"::	And probably is not so easy::	0
"mn005"::	when you use the - the P_D_A, eh that -::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	Because the signal is, eh  the - in the e- energy level.::	0
"mn005"::	in - in that, eh  eh  speech file  is, eh  more similar.::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	between the different eh, speaker,  um::	0
"me011"::	But different  speakers.::	0
"mn005"::	I - I think is - eh, it will  i- is my opinion.  It will be, eh  more difficult to - to detect::	0
"mn005"::	bass-tone  energy.::	0
"mn005"::	the - the change.::	0
"mn005"::	I think that, um  In the P_D_A. Yeah.  Yeah. And the - the another question, that when::	0
"me011"::	Ah, in the clo- in the P_D_ A,  you mean?  Absolutely. Yeah, no  question.  It'll be  much  harder.  Much  harder.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	I review the - the - the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn,  that the idea of using a  neural network::	0
"mn005"::	to - to get a broad class of phonetic, eh  from, eh uh::	0
"mn005"::	a candidate from the - the - the speech signal.::	0
"mn005"::	If you have, eh::	0
"mn005"::	uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh  only consider, eh  like candidate, the, nnn, eh  the silence, because it is the - the only model, eh - eh, he used that, eh   eh  nnn,::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	to detect::	0
"mn005"::	the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker,  Um  another - another research thing, different groups, eh  working, eh  on Broadcast News  prefer to, eh::	0
"mn005"::	to consider hypothesis::	0
"mn005"::	eh  between each phoneme.::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, when a   phone  changes.::	0
"mn005"::	Because, I - I - I think it's more realistic that, uh  only consider the -  the  the - the silence between the speaker.  Eh  there - there  exists::	0
"mn005"::	eh  silence between - between, eh  a speaker.::	0
"mn005"::	is - is, eh  eh  acoustic, eh::	0
"mn005"::	event, important to - to consider.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	I - I found that the, eh  silence in - in many occasions in the - in the speech file,  but, eh  when you have, eh  eh, two speakers together::	0
"mn005"::	without enough silence between - between  them , eh::	0
"mn005"::	I think::	0
"mn005"::	eh  is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I - I - I::	0
"mn005"::	I_X or, mmm,  BIC   criterion for consider all the frames::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	in my opinion.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, the - you know, the reason that he, uh  just used silence::	0
"me013"::	was not because he thought it was  better,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	it was - it was - it was the place he was  starting.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"me013"::	So, he was trying to get something going, and, uh e- e- you know, as - as -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	as is in  your  case, if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Do  something.::	0
"me013"::	pick a realistic goal,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah,::	0
"me013"::	But his - his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also.::	0
"mn005"::	yeah, yeah, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Uh-huh.::	0
"mn005"::	But, eh  do - do you think that if you consider all the frames::	0
"mn005"::	to apply::	0
"mn005"::	the - the, eh::	0
"mn005"::	the::	0
"mn005"::	BIC   criterion::	0
"mn005"::	to detect the - the - the different acoustic change,  eh  between speaker, without, uh  with, uh  silence or  with overlapping, uh, I think like - like, eh  eh::	0
"mn005"::	a general, eh::	0
"mn005"::	eh  way of process the - the acoustic change.::	0
"mn005"::	In a first step, I mean.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	An- and then, eh::	0
"mn005"::	eh  without considering the you - you - you, um  you can consider the energy::	0
"mn005"::	like a- another parameter in the - in the feature vector, eh.::	0
"me011"::	Right. Absolutely.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	This -  this  is the idea. And if, if you do that, eh  eh, with a  BIC   uh criterion for example, or with another kind of, eh  of  distance  in a first step,  and then you, eh  you get the, eh  the hypothesis::	0
"mn005"::	to the -  this  change acoustic,  eh::	0
"mn005"::	to  po-  process::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"mn005"::	Because, eh  eh, probably you - you can find the - the::	0
"mn005"::	eh  a small gap of silence between speaker  with eh  eh  a ga- mmm,::	0
"mn005"::	small duration::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	Less than,  eh  two hundred milliseconds for example  and apply another - another algorithm, another approach like, eh  eh  detector of  ene- , eh detector of  bass-tone  energy to - to consider that, eh::	0
"mn005"::	that, eh  zone.::	0
"mn005"::	of s- a small silence between speaker,  or::	0
"mn005"::	another algorithm to - to process,  eh  the - the segment between marks::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	eh  founded by the - the::	0
"mn005"::	the  BIC   criterion and applied for - for each frame. I think is, eh::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	nnn,::	0
"mn005"::	it will be a- an - an - a more general approach::	0
"mn005"::	the  if we compare - with use, eh  a neural net or another, eh  speech recognizer with a broad class or - or narrow class, because, in my opinion::	0
"mn005"::	eh  it's in my opinion,  eh::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	if you - if you change::	0
"mn005"::	the condition of the speech, I mean, if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to, eh::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	to, eh   adapt::	0
"mn005"::	the neural net, eh  used by Javier with a mixed file.::	0
"me011"::	With the  what  file?::	0
"mn005"::	uh::	0
"mn005"::	With a m-  mixed  file,::	0

"me013"::	Well, I -::	0
"me011"::	Oh,  absolutely.  This is - this is not what I was suggesting to do.::	0
"me013"::	I - u-::	0
"mn005"::	to -::	0
"mn005"::	to retrain it.::	0
"me013"::	Look, I - I think this is a -::	0
"mn005"::	Really?::	0
"me013"::	One - once -::	0
"me013"::	It's a - I used to work,  like , on voiced - on voice silence detection, you know, and this is this  kind of thing.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um::	0
"me013"::	If you::	0
"me013"::	have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing, and they work on it for a couple months,::	0
"me013"::	they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily.::	0
"me013"::	Then you say, "O_K, I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate."::	0
"me013"::	Then it gets  really  hard no matter what you do.::	0
"me013"::	So, the p- the problem is is that if you say, "Well::	0
"me013"::	I -::	0
"me013"::	I have these  other  data over  here,::	0
"me013"::	that I  learn  things from, either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever."::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh::	0
"me013"::	Suppose you  don't  use any of those things. You say you have::	0
"me013"::	looked for acoustic change. Well, what does that  mean?::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	That - that means you set some  thresholds  somewhere or something, right?::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	and - and so  where do you get your  thresholds  from?::	0
"me013"::	From something that you  looked  at. So::	0
"me013"::	you  always  have this problem, you're going to  new  data::	0
"me013"::	um::	1
"me013"::	H- how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data?::	0
"me013"::	Uh, if it's gonna be different from old data that you have?::	1
"me013"::	And I think that's a problem::	0
"me011"::	Well, also what  I'm  doing right now is  not   intended  to be an acoustic change detector for far-field  mikes.  What  I'm  doing::	1
"me013"::	with this.::	1
"me011"::	is trying to use the  close-talking  mike::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah!::	0
"me011"::	and just use -::	0
"mn017"::	Actually -::	0
"me018"::	You have  candidates.::	0
"me011"::	Can-  and just generate candidate and just   try  to get a  first   pass  at something that  sort  of  works.::	1
"mn017"::	actually - actually -::	0
"mn005"::	the candidate.::	0
"mn017"::	I -::	0
"me018"::	to make  marking  easier.::	0
"mn017"::	Or -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	and I  haven't  spent a lot of  time  on it and I'm not  intending  to spend a lot of time on it.::	0
"mn017"::	O_K.::	0
"mn017"::	I -::	0
"me011"::	So.::	0
"mn017"::	um, I, unfortunately, have to run, but, um::	1
"mn017"::	I can imagine  uh building  a  um::	0
"mn017"::	model of speaker change  detection  that::	0
"mn017"::	takes into account  both the  far-field  and the::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn017"::	uh  actually,  not  just the  close-talking  mike for that  speaker,  but actually for  all  of th-::	0
"me011"::	Everyone else.::	0
"mn017"::	for  all  of the speakers.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	um::	0
"mn017"::	If you  model  the -::	0
"mn017"::	the  effect that::	0
"mn017"::	me  speaking has on::	0
"mn017"::	your  microphone and everybody else's microphone, as  well  as on that,::	0
"mn017"::	and you build, um -::	0
"mn017"::	basically I think you'd - you would::	0
"mn017"::	build a -::	0
"mn017"::	an H_M_M that has::	0
"mn017"::	as a  state  space all of the  possible   speaker  combinations::	0
"me011"::	All the - Yep.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn017"::	and, um::	0
"mn017"::	you can control -::	0
"me011"::	It's a little big.::	0
"mn017"::	It's not that big actually, um::	0
"me011"::	Two to the  N_ .::	0
"me011"::	Two to the number of people in the meeting.::	0
"me013"::	But -::	0
"me011"::	Anyway.::	0
"me013"::	Actually, Andreas may- maybe - maybe just something  simpler  but - but::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	along the lines of what you're saying, I was just realizing, I used to know this guy who used to build, uh::	0
"mn017"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	um,  mike  mixers - automatic  mike  mixers where, you know, t- in order to able to turn up the gain,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah::	0
"mn017"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	you know, uh::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	as much as you  can,  you -::	0
"me013"::	you - you  lower  the gain on - on the mikes of people who aren't  talking,  right?::	0
"mn017"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And then he had some sort of::	0
"me013"::	reasonable way of  doing  that, but::	1
"me013"::	uh, what if you were just looking at very  simple  measures  like  energy measures but you  don't  just compare it to some  threshold    overall  but you compare it to the  energy  in  the other  microphones.::	1
"me011"::	I was  thinking  about doing that  originally  to find out::	1
"me011"::	who's  the  loudest,::	1
"me011"::	and  that  person is  certainly   talking.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	But I  also  wanted to find  threshold  - uh, excuse me, mol-  overlap.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	So, not just - just the loudest.::	0
"fe008"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn005"::	But, eh::	0
"mn005"::	I - I::	0
"mn005"::	Sorry. I - I have found that when - when I::	0
"mn017"::	Sorry, I have to go.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"mn005"::	I analyzed the - the speech files from the,  eh  mike, eh  from the eh close eh  microphone, eh  I found zones::	0
"me011"::	Could you fill that out anyway?::	0
"me011"::	Just,  put your name in.::	0
"me011"::	Are y- you want me to do it? I'll do it.::	0
"me018"::	But  he's  not gonna even  read  that.::	0
"me011"::	I know.::	0
"me018"::	Oh.::	0
"mn005"::	with a - a different level of energy.::	0
"mn005"::	including overlap zone.::	0
"mn005"::	including.::	0
"mn005"::	because, eh  eh  depend on the position of the - of the microph- of the each speaker  to, eh, to get::	0
"mn005"::	more o- or less energy::	0
"mn005"::	i- in the mixed sign- in the signal.::	0
"mn005"::	and then,  if you consider energy to - to detect overlapping::	0
"mn005"::	in - in, uh, and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals.  The mixed signals, eh.::	0
"mn005"::	I - I think it's - it's difficult, um   only to  en-  with energy to - to consider that in that zone::	1
"mn005"::	We have eh, eh, overlapping zone::	0
"mn005"::	Eh, if you process only the the energy of the, of each frame.::	1
"me013"::	Well, it's probably harder, but I - I think what I was s-::	1
"me013"::	nnn::	0
"me013"::	noting::	0
"me013"::	just when he - when Andreas  raised  that, was that there's  other  information to be gained from looking at all::	0
"me013"::	of the microphones and you may not need to look at very  sophisticated  things,::	1
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	because if there's -::	0
"me013"::	if  most  of the overlaps -::	0
"me013"::	you know, this doesn't cover, say,  three,  but if  most  of the overlaps, say, are  two,::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	if the distribution looks like there's a  couple   high  ones and - and  the rest of them are  low,  you know, what I mean,  there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	And everyone else is low, yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, by the way, I had an idea with - while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things, is that we can all wear little bells on our heads,::	0
"me013"::	so that::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0

"fe016"::	Then -::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.  The question is,  like  whether -::	0

"me013"::	Mm-hmm?::	0
"fe016"::	You know, if you watch people they'll actually  do  these things. So.::	0
"fe016"::	I still think we should try a - a meeting or two with the blindfolds, at  least  of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of::	0
"me011"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe016"::	Um, maybe for  part  of the meeting, we don't have to do it the  whole  meeting.::	0

"me013"::	I think it's a  great  idea.::	0
"fe016"::	That could be fun.::	0

"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	you know, I can see  Chuck  even if you put a barrier  here.::	0

"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	you know, pretty l- large partitions.::	0
"fe016"::	But then we  also  have  these  mikes, is the other thing I was thinking, so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb::	1

"me011"::	It's just, uh   beeping  out parts that you don't want included in the meeting so, you know::	1

"mn014"::	O_K, O_K.::	0
"mn014"::	I got that.::	0

"mn014"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	But you don't want to just totally excise it because::	0
"me013"::	um::	0
"me013"::	uh, well you have to be  careful  about excising it, how - how you excise it keeping the timing right and so forth so that at the  moment::	0
"me013"::	tho- th- the idea we're running with is - is h- putting the beep over it.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, you can either  beep  or it can be  silence.  I - I couldn't  decide.::	0
"mn014"::	O_K.::	0
"mn005"::	Ah, yeah.::	0
"me011"::	which was the  right  way to do it.  Beep  is good  auditorily,::	0
"me011"::	if someone is  listening  to it, there's no mistake that it's been beeped out,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	but for  software  it's probably better for it to be  silence.::	0
"me018"::	No,  no. You can - you know, you could make a m-::	0
"fe008"::	Hmm.::	0
"me018"::	as long as you keep using the same  beep,::	0
"me018"::	people  could make a  model  of that  beep,  and -::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"fe008"::	I  like  that idea.::	1
"me011"::	And I use - it's - it's, uh::	0
"fe016"::	I think the beep is a really good idea.::	0
"me011"::	it's an A_ below middle C_ beep, so::	0
"fe008"::	It's  very   clear.  Then you don't think it's a long pause.::	0
"me018"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	Also -::	0
"me018"::	Yeah, it's  more   obvious  that there  was  something  there  than if there's just silence.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, that - I mean, he's - he's  removing  the old   thing  and - and - and -::	0

"me018"::	But I mean if you just replaced it with  silence,::	0
"mn014"::	Yeah.::	0
"me018"::	it's not clear whether that's really  silence  or -::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, I agree.::	0
"me011"::	Yep.::	0
"mn014"::	@@::	0
"mn005"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	One - one question. Do you do it on  all  channels?::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Of course.::	0
"fe008"::	Interesting.  I  like  that.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah, I like that. Very clear.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's, uh   audible.::	0
"me011"::	Uh, it's - it's  potentially  audible, you could potentially recover it.::	0
"fe008"::	Very clear.::	0
"me013"::	Ke- keep a back door.::	0
"fe008"::	Well, the other thing that - you know, I mean the - the alternative might be to s-::	0
"me011"::	Yeah.::	0
"me011"::	Well, I - I  haven't  thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped. Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then, uh::	0
"me011"::	the ar- DARPA meeting.::	0
"fe016"::	Notice how  quiet  I am.::	0
"me011"::	Sorry, and then the  DARPA  meeting I just excised  completely,  so it's in a private directory.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe016"::	You have   some  people who  only  have beeps as their speech in these meetings.::	0
"fe008"::	That's  great.::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me018"::	They're easy to find, then.::	0
"me013"::	Alright, so, uh  I think we should, uh  uh, go on to the digits?::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	I have one concept a- t- I - I want to say,::	0
"fe008"::	which is that I think it's nice that you're preserving the  time  relations,::	0
"fe008"::	s- so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing  scissor  snips. You're - you're keeping the, uh::	0
"me011"::	Right.::	0
"fe008"::	the time duration of a -  de - deleted - deleted part.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah, definitely.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K, good, digits.::	0
"me011"::	Yeah, since we wanna  possibly synchronize these things as well.::	0
"me011"::	Oh, I should have  done  that. Shoot.  Oh well.::	0
"fe008"::	It's great.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Oh-::	0
"fe016"::	So I guess if there's an overlap,::	0
"fe016"::	like, if I'm saying something that's  bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped, too?::	0
"me011"::	You'll lose it. There's no way around that.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um::	0
"me013"::	I d- I did -::	0
"me013"::	before we do the digits, I did also wanna remind people, uh::	0
"me013"::	please do send me, you know,::	0
"me013"::	uh::	0
"me013"::	thoughts for an agenda, yeah that - that would be::	0
"me011"::	Agenda?::	0
"me018"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fe008"::	Good.::	1
"me013"::	that'd be good.::	0
"me013"::	Eh::	0
"me013"::	So that, uh, people's ideas don't get   yeah, well::	0
"me011"::	Thursday crept up on me this week.::	0
"me013"::	it does creep up, doesn't it?::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	And,  I  wanted to say, I think this is really  interesting::	0
"me011"::	It's cool stuff, definitely.::	0
"fe008"::	Thank  you.  Thank  you.::	1
"fe016"::	analysis.  I  meant  to say that before I started off on the   Switchboard  stuff. It's  neat.::	0
"me011"::	I was gonna say "can you do that for the other meetings, can you do it for them?" And,  no  actually, you  can't.::	0
"fe016"::	Yeah.  Does it take -::	0
"fe008"::	Thank you.::	0
"me018"::	Actually - actually I - I thought that's what you were giving us was  another   meeting  and I was like, "Oh, O_K!"::	0
"me011"::	"Ooo, cool!"::	0
"fe008"::	Yeah. Aw, thanks.::	0
"fe016"::	How long does it  take, just briefly, like::	0
"fe008"::	No.::	0
"fe008"::	I  have  the  script  now, so, I mean, it can work off the, uh::	1
"fe016"::	t- to -::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	It's -::	0
"fe016"::	to label the, O_K.::	0
"fe008"::	other thing ,::	1
"me011"::	As soon as we get labels, yep.::	0
"me018"::	But it has to be  hand-labeled   first?::	0
"fe008"::	but -::	0
"fe008"::	Uh, well,  yeah.  Because, uh  well, I mean::	0
"fe008"::	once  his  - his algorithm is up and running::	0
"me011"::	If it  works  well enough.::	0
"fe008"::	then we can do it  that  way.::	0
"me011"::	Right now it's  not.::	0
"fe008"::	But  I - I just worked off of my::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	O_K,  go ahead::	0
"fe016"::	It's really neat.::	0
"fe008"::	Thanks.::	0
"fe008"::	Appreciate  that.::	0
"me011"::	Not  quite  to the point where it works.::	0
"fe008"::	I think - what I - what this has, uh, caused me - so this  discussion::	1
"fe008"::	caused me to wanna  subdivide  these further. I'm gonna take a look at the, uh  backchannels, how much we have::	1
"fe008"::	anal- I hope to have that for next time.::	1
"me011"::	Yeah, my - my algorithm worked  great  actually on  these,::	0
"me018"::	That'd be interesting.::	0
"me011"::	but when you wear it like  that  or with the::	0
"me011"::	uh,  lapel::	0
"me011"::	or if you have it  very  far from your  face,  that's when it starts  failing.::	0

"me018"::	Oh.::	0
"fe016"::	I mean if you -::	0

"me018"::	It's too late  now.::	0
"fe016"::	I feel like this  troublemaker.::	0
"me011"::	It's uh -::	0

"me011"::	prescriptions on how you wear  microphones.::	0
"fe016"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	Get the bolts, "whh whh"::	0
"me013"::	O_K, that's - let's - let's - let's do digits.::	0
"fe008"::	Let's do it.::	0
"fe008"::	O_K.::	0
"me011"::	O_K.::	0
"fe016"::	I'm sorry.::	0
"me011"::	O_K, thank you.::	0
"fe008"::	Do you want us to put a  mark  on the  bottom  of these when they've actually been  read,  or::	0
"fe008"::	do you just::	0
"fe008"::	i-::	0
"fe008"::	the only one that  wasn't  read is -::	0
