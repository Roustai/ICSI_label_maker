"mn007"::	what has been done -::	0
"mn007"::	It's this.::	0
"mn007"::	Summary of experiments since, well, since last week and also since the -::	0
"me013"::	Oh. O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	we've started to  run  - work on this.::	0
"mn007"::	Um.  So since last week we've started to fill the column with um::	0
"mn007"::	uh features::	0
"mn007"::	w- with nets trained on P_L_P::	0
"mn007"::	with on-line normalization but with delta also, because the column was not completely - well, it's still not completely filled, but::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	we have more results to compare with network using without P_L_P and::	0
"mn007"::	finally, hhh,  um  ehhh   P_L- uh delta seems very important.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh  I don't know. If you take um,::	0
"mn007"::	let's say,::	0
"mn007"::	anyway  Aurora-two-B_,::	0
"mn007"::	so, the next - t- the second, uh, part of the table,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	uh  when we use the large training set using French, Spanish, and English,::	0
"mn007"::	you have one hundred and six::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	without delta and eighty-nine with the delta.::	0
"me013"::	a- And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being, uh, the baseline performance, but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the H_T_K? Yes.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, on the baseline, yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	So -::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much  uh::	0
"mn007"::	uh::	0
"mn007"::	much smaller::	0
"me006"::	It's out of the way.::	0
"mn007"::	um -::	0
"me006"::	Right.::	0
"mn007"::	But,::	0
"mn007"::	actually, um,::	0
"mn007"::	for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages.::	0
"mn007"::	And::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm,  Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	And f- also for Italian, actually.::	0
"mn007"::	If you take the second::	0
"mn007"::	set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	um::	0
"mn007"::	when we use the training on TIMIT::	0
"mn007"::	so, it's multi-English, we have a ninety-one number,::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	and training with other languages is a little bit worse.::	0
"me013"::	Um -::	0
"me013"::	Oh,  I  see. Down near the bottom of this sheet.::	0
"me013"::	Uh,   yes.::	0
"mn007"::	So, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta.::	0
"mn007"::	If y- if I take the training s- the large training set, it's - we have one hundred and seventy-two,::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	and one hundred and four when we use delta.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh.::	0
"mn007"::	Even if the contexts used is quite the same, because without delta we use  seventeenths - seventeen  frames.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross-language experiments,::	0
"mn007"::	uh, that we did not have last week.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, so this is::	0
"mn007"::	training the net on French::	0
"mn007"::	only, or on English only, and testing on Italian.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0

"mn007"::	T_I-digits.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	And, fff  um,::	0
"mn007"::	yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	What we see is that::	0
"mn007"::	these nets are not as good, except for the multi-English, which is always one of the best.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, then we started to work::	0
"mn007"::	on a large dat- database containing,::	0
"mn007"::	uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE,::	0
"mn007"::	uh from::	0

"mn007"::	Uh,  @@  with SPINE and::	0
"mn007"::	uh, actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data,::	0

"mn007"::	Yeah, so basically there are four -::	0

"fn002"::	Yeah, this number recognition acc-::	0
"mn007"::	So it's not the -  Again we switch to another -::	0
"fn002"::	Yes, and the baseline - the baseline have - i- is eighty-two.::	1
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Baseline is eighty-two.::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah::	0
"mn007"::	So it's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, this is Italian mismatched. O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah, by the moment.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	And first in the experiment-one::	1
"fn002"::	I - I do -::	0
"fn002"::	I - I use different M_L_P,::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	and::	1
"fn002"::	is obviously that the multi-English M_L_P is the better.::	1
"fn002"::	Um.::	1
"fn002"::	for the ne - rest of experiment I use multi-English,::	1
"fn002"::	only multi-English.::	0
"fn002"::	And I try to combine different type of feature, but the result::	1
"fn002"::	is that the M_S_G-three feature doesn't work for the Italian database::	1
"fn002"::	because never help to increase the  accuracy.::	1
"mn007"::	Yeah, eh, actually, if w- we look at the table, the huge table,::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	1
"mn007"::	um, we see that for T_I-digits M_S_G perform as well as the P_L_P,::	1
"mn007"::	but this is not the case for Italian what - where the error rate is c- is almost uh twice the error rate of P_L_P.::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	So, um::	0
"mn007"::	uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this - this is something in - probably in the M_S_G::	0
"mn007"::	um process that::	0
"mn007"::	uh::	0
"mn007"::	I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the - the -::	1
"mn007"::	there's no low-pass filter, well, or no pre-emp- pre-emphasis filter and that::	1
"mn007"::	there is some D_C offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that.::	1
"mn007"::	But - that we need to sort out if want to::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	uh get improvement by combining P_L_P and M_S_G because::	1
"mn007"::	for the moment M_S_G do- doesn't bring much information. And::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	I-::	0
"mn007"::	as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of P_L_P.::	0
"me013"::	Um, the uh,  baseline  system - when you said the  baseline  system was uh, uh eighty-two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what?::	1
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	That was, uh Italian mismatched d- uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing, and the training is Italian digits?::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	1
"me013"::	So the "mismatch" just refers to the noise and - and, uh microphone and so forth, right?::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So, um::	0
"me013"::	did we have - So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is - is the uh Italian digits?::	0
"me013"::	The - 3x::	0
"fn002"::	The train- the training of the H_T_K? Yes. Ah yes! This h- Yes. Th- Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Yes.::	0
"me013"::	Yes. Training of the net, yeah.::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So, um - So what that says is that in a matched condition,::	0
"me013"::	we end up with a fair amount  worse  putting in the uh P_L_P.::	1
"me013"::	Now w- would - do we have a number,::	1
"me013"::	I suppose for the matched -::	1
"me013"::	I - I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian - training in Italian digits for P_L_P only?::	1
"fn002"::	Uh  yes?::	0
"mn007"::	Uh  yeah, so this is - basically this is in the table.::	1
"mn007"::	Uh  so the number is fifty-two,::	1
"fn002"::	Another table.::	1
"mn007"::	uh -::	0
"me013"::	Fifty-two percent.::	1
"mn007"::	Fift- So -::	1
"fn002"::	No.::	0
"me013"::	No, fifty-two percent of eighty-two?::	1
"mn007"::	No, it's - it's the -::	1
"mn007"::	Of - of -::	1
"mn007"::	of uh  eighteen - of eighteen.::	1
"fn002"::	Eighty. Eighty.::	1
"mn007"::	So it's - it's error rate, basically. It's er- error rate ratio. So -::	1
"fn002"::	It's::	1
"fn002"::	plus six.::	1
"me013"::	Oh this is  accuracy!  Oy!  O_K.::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	1
"mn007"::	Uh, so we have nine - nine - let's say ninety percent.::	1
"me013"::	Ninety.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Um::	0
"mn007"::	which is::	0
"mn007"::	uh::	0
"mn007"::	what we have also if use P_L_P and M_S_G together, eighty-nine point seven.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K, so even just::	0
"me013"::	P_L_P,::	0
"me013"::	uh, it is not, in the matched condition -::	0
"me013"::	Um::	0
"me013"::	I wonder if it's a difference between P_L_P and mel cepstra,::	0
"me013"::	or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh.::	0
"mn007"::	P_- P_L_P and Mel cepstra give the same -::	0
"me013"::	Same result pretty much?::	0
"mn007"::	same results. Well, we have these results. I don't know. It's not -::	0
"me013"::	So, s-::	0
"mn007"::	Do you have this result with P_L_P alone,::	0
"mn007"::	j- fee- feeding H_T_K? That - That's what you mean?::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first -::	0
"mn007"::	Just P_L_P at the input of H_T_K.::	0
"fn002"::	and the -::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	So, P_L_P -::	0
"me013"::	Eighty-eight point six.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Um, so adding M_S_G::	0
"mn007"::	Um -::	0
"me013"::	um -::	0
"me013"::	Well, but that's - yeah, that's without the neural net, right?::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, that's without the neural net and that's the result basically that O_G_I has also with the M_F_C_C with on-line normalization.::	0
"me013"::	But she had said eighty- two.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"mn007"::	This is the - w- well, but this is without on-line normalization.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, this -::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	@@::	0
"me013"::	the eighty- two.::	0
"mn007"::	Eighty-two is the - it's the Aurora baseline, so M_F_C_C.::	0
"mn007"::	Then we can use -::	0
"mn007"::	well, O_G_I, they use M_F_C_C -::	0
"mn007"::	th- the baseline M_F_C_C::	0
"me013"::	Oh,  I'm  sorry, I k- I keep getting confused because this is  accuracy.::	1
"mn007"::	plus on-line normalization::	0
"mn007"::	@@  Yeah, sorry. Yeah.::	1
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Alright. Alright. So this is - I was thinking all this was  worse.  O_K so this is all  better  because eighty- nine  is  bigger  than eighty-two. O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Yes, better.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	I'm - I'm all better now. O_K, go ahead.::	0
"mn007"::	So what happ- what happens is that when we::	0
"mn007"::	apply on-line normalization::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	we jump to almost ninety percent.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j- jump to ninety percent.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Nnn, we don't  know  exactly.::	0
"mn007"::	And -::	0
"mn007"::	And um -::	0
"mn007"::	whatever the normalization, actually.::	0
"mn007"::	If we use n- neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized,::	0
"mn007"::	we jump to ninety percent.::	0
"me013"::	So we go from eighty-si- eighty-eight point six to - to ninety, or something.::	0
"mn007"::	So -::	0
"mn007"::	Well, ninety -::	0
"mn007"::	No, I - I mean ninety- It's around eighty-nine, ninety,  eighty-eight .::	0
"me013"::	Eighty-nine.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Well, there are  minor   - minor differences.::	0
"me013"::	And then adding the M_S_G does nothing, basically.::	1
"mn007"::	No.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh::	0
"mn007"::	For   Italian, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	For  this  case, right?::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"me013"::	Alright.::	0
"me013"::	So, um - So actually, the answer for experiments with one is that adding M_S_G, if you - uh does  not  help in that case.::	1
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	1
"me013"::	Um -::	0
"me013"::	The other ones, we'd have to look at it, but -::	0
"mn007"::	But w- Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And the multi-English, does::	0
"me013"::	uh -::	0
"me013"::	So if we think of this in  error  rates,::	0
"me013"::	we start off with, uh eighteen percent error rate, roughly.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Um  and  we uh::	0
"me013"::	almost, uh cut that in half::	0
"me013"::	by um::	0
"me013"::	putting in the on-line normalization and the neural net.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah::	0
"me013"::	And the M_S_G doesn't however particularly affect things.::	0
"mn007"::	No.::	0
"me013"::	And we::	0
"me013"::	cut off, I guess about twenty-five percent of the error.::	0
"me013"::	Uh  no, not quite that,  is  it. Uh, two point six::	0
"me013"::	out of eighteen. About,::	0
"me013"::	um::	0
"me013"::	sixteen percent or something of the error,::	0
"me013"::	um, if we use multi-English instead of the matching condition.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Not  matching  condition, but uh, the uh, Italian training.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"fn002"::	We select these - these - these  tasks   because it's the more difficult.::	0
"me013"::	Yes, good.::	0
"me013"::	O_K?::	0
"me013"::	So then you're assuming multi-English is  closer  to the kind of thing that you could  use  since you're not gonna have matching,::	1
"me013"::	uh, data for the - uh for the new - for the other languages and so forth.::	1
"me013"::	Um,::	0
"me013"::	one qu- thing is that, uh - I think I asked you this before, but I wanna double check. When you say::	0
"me013"::	"M_E" in these other tests,::	0
"me013"::	that's the multi-English, but it is not  all  of the multi-English, right? It is some  piece  of -  part  of it.::	0
"mn007"::	That's -::	0
"mn007"::	it's a part - it's -::	0
"mn007"::	Or, one million frames.::	0
"me013"::	And the multi-English is how much?::	0
"fn002"::	You have here the information.::	0
"mn007"::	It's one million and a half.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Oh, so you used  almost  all- You used  two   thirds  of it,::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	you think.::	0
"me013"::	So, it- it's still - it hurts you - seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish.::	1
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	I wonder why  Yeah.::	1
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me006"::	Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand-labeled,::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, it's - Yeah.::	0
"me006"::	the French and the Spanish.::	1
"fn002"::	The Spanish.::	0
"fn002"::	Maybe for that.::	0
"me006"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	1
"me013"::	It's  still -::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Alright, go ahead.  And then - then -::	0
"fn002"::	Um.::	0
"fn002"::	Mmm, with the::	0
"fn002"::	experiment type-two,::	0
"fn002"::	I - first I tried to- to combine, nnn, some feature from the M_L_P and other feature -::	0
"fn002"::	another feature.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	And we s-::	0
"fn002"::	we can -::	0
"fn002"::	first the feature are  without  delta and delta-delta,::	1
"fn002"::	and we can see that in the situation,::	1
"fn002"::	uh, the M_S_G-three,::	0
"fn002"::	the  same  help nothing.::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	And then I do the same but with the delta and delta-delta - P_L_P delta and delta-delta.::	1
"fn002"::	And they all p-::	0
"fn002"::	but they all put off the M_L_P  is it  without delta and delta-delta.::	0
"fn002"::	And we have a l- little bit less result than the -::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	the -::	0
"fn002"::	the baseline P_L_P with delta and delta-delta.::	0
"fn002"::	Maybe if - when we have the new -::	0
"fn002"::	the new  neural network  trained   with P_L_P delta and delta-delta, maybe the final result must be better. I don't know.::	0
"fn002"::	Uh -::	0
"mn007"::	Actually, just to be some more -::	0
"mn007"::	Do- This number, this eighty-seven point one number,::	0
"mn007"::	has to be compared with the um  -::	0
"mn007"::	Which  number?::	0
"me013"::	Yes, yeah, I mean it can't be compared with the  other  cuz this is, uh - with multi-English, uh, training. So you have to compare it with the one  over  that you've got in a  box,  which is that, uh the eighty-four point six.::	0
"fn002"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Right?::	0
"mn007"::	Uh.::	0
"me013"::	So -::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, but I mean in this case for the eighty-seven point one we used::	0
"mn007"::	M_L_P outputs for the P_L_P net::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	and straight features with delta-delta.::	1
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	And  straight  features with delta-delta::	0
"mn007"::	gives you what's on the first sheet. It's eight- eighty-eight point six.::	0
"me013"::	Not t- not tr-::	0
"me013"::	No. No. No. Not trained with multi- English.::	0
"fn002"::	Yes.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, yeah, but th- this is the second configuration. So we use::	0
"fn002"::	No, but they - they  feature   @@  without -::	0
"mn007"::	feature out- uh, net outputs together with features.::	0
"mn007"::	So yeah, this is not - perhaps not clear  here  but in this table,::	1
"mn007"::	the first column is for M_L_P and the second for the features.::	0
"me013"::	Eh.  Oh,  I  see.::	0
"me013"::	Ah. So you're saying w- so asking the question, "What - what has adding the M_L_P done to improve over the, uh -  Yes.::	0
"mn007"::	So,::	0
"mn007"::	just -::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah so, actually it - it - it decreased the - the accuracy.::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Uh- huh.::	0
"mn007"::	Because we have eighty-eight point six.::	0
"mn007"::	And even the M_L_P alone -::	0
"mn007"::	What gives the M_L_P alone?::	0
"mn007"::	Multi-English P_L_P. Oh no, it gives eighty- three  point six.::	0
"fn002"::	But -::	0
"mn007"::	So we have  our  eighty-three point six and  now  eighty-eighty point six, that gives eighty-seven point one.::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	Eighty-s- I thought it was eighty- Oh, O_K, eighty-three point six and eighty - eighty- eight  point six.::	0
"mn007"::	Eighty-three point six. Eighty -::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Is th- is that right?::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah?::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	But -::	0
"fn002"::	I don't know - but maybe if we have the neural network  trained   with the P_L_P  delta and delta-delta,::	0
"fn002"::	maybe::	0
"fn002"::	tha- this can help.::	0
"mn007"::	Perhaps, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Well, that's - that's  one  thing, but see the  other  thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult  case,  but let's - let's consider what that  means.::	0
"me013"::	What - what we're saying is that one o- one of the things that - I mean  my  interpretation of your - your s- original suggestion is something like this, as  motivation.::	1
"me013"::	When we train on  data  that is in  one  sense or  another,::	1
"me013"::	similar  to the  testing  data,::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	then we get a  win  by having  discriminant    training.::	1
"me013"::	When we train on something that's quite  different,::	1
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	we have a potential to have some  problems.::	1
"me013"::	And, um,  if  we get something that  helps  us when it's somewhat  similar,::	0
"me013"::	and doesn't  hurt  us too  much  when it - when it's quite different,::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	that's maybe not so  bad.::	0
"me013"::	So the question is, if you took the  same  combination,::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	and you tried it out on, uh - on say  digits,::	0
"mn007"::	On T_I-digits? O_K. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	you know, d- Was that experiment done?::	0
"mn007"::	No, not yet.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, O_K.::	0
"me013"::	Uh, then does that,::	0
"me013"::	eh - you know maybe with similar  noise  conditions and so forth,::	0
"me013"::	does it - does it then look much  better?::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh - of tests?::	0
"me013"::	So, an-  anyway.::	0
"me013"::	O_K, go ahead.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah. Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	And, with this type of configuration which I do on experiment::	0
"fn002"::	using the new neural net::	0
"fn002"::	with name  broad klatt  s- twenty-seven, uh, d- I have found more or less the same result.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	So, it's::	0
"fn002"::	Little bit better?::	0
"mn007"::	slightly  better, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Slightly  better.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Slightly bet- better. Yes, is better.::	0
"me013"::	And - and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.::	0
"me013"::	there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at  least  about the  same  for a difficult  case.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Oh, yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Oh, yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So.::	0
"mn007"::	Well, so perhaps let's - let's jump at the last experiment. It's::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output.::	1
"fn002"::	i-::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	It's again better. So it's eighty-nine point - point one.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah,::	0
"fn002"::	and we have only forty - forty feature::	0
"mn007"::	So.::	1
"fn002"::	because in this situation we have one hundred and three::	0
"fn002"::	feature.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	And then w- with the  first  configuration, I f-::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	I am found that::	0
"fn002"::	work,::	0
"fn002"::	uh, doesn't work -::	0
"fn002"::	uh, well,::	0
"fn002"::	work,  but is better, the second configuration.::	0
"fn002"::	Because I - for the del- Engli- P_L_P delta and delta-delta,::	0
"fn002"::	here I have eighty-five point three  accuracy,   and::	0
"fn002"::	with the second configuration I have eighty-seven point one.::	0
"me013"::	Um, by the way, there is a- another, uh, suggestion that would apply, uh, to the second configuration,::	0
"me013"::	um, which, uh, was made, uh, by, uh, Hari.::	0
"me013"::	And that was that, um, if you have - uh feed two streams into H_T_K,::	0
"me013"::	um, and you, uh, change the, uh  variances  -::	0
"me013"::	if you scale the variances associated with, uh these streams::	0
"me013"::	um, you can effectively  scale   the streams.::	0
"me013"::	Right? So, um,::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	you know, without  changing  the  scripts  for H_T_K, which is the rule here,::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	uh, you can still  change  the  variances  which would effectively change the scale of these - these, uh, two  streams  that come in.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh,  yeah.::	0
"me013"::	And, um,::	0
"me013"::	so,::	0
"me013"::	um, if you  do  that,::	0
"me013"::	for instance it may be the case::	0
"me013"::	that, um,::	0
"me013"::	the M_L_P should not be considered as strongly,::	0
"me013"::	for instance.::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	And, um, so this is just setting them to be,::	0
"me013"::	excuse me,  of equal - equal weight.::	0
"me013"::	Maybe it  shouldn't  be equal weight.::	0
"fn002"::	Maybe.::	0
"me013"::	Right?  You know, I- I'm sorry to say that gives  more  experiments if we wanted to  look  at that, but -::	0
"me013"::	but, uh, um, you know on the other hand it's just experiments at the level of the H_T_K  recognition.  It's not even the H_T_K, uh,::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	uh - Well, I guess you have to do the H_T_K training also. Uh,  do  you?::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	so this is what we  decided to do.::	0
"me013"::	Let me think.::	0
"me013"::	Maybe you  don't.::	0
"me013"::	Uh.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, you have to change the -::	0
"me013"::	No, you can just do it in - as - once you've done the training -::	0
"me006"::	And then you can vary it. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could -::	0
"me013"::	you  could just  scale  them all.::	0
"mn007"::	Scale the - ?::	0
"me013"::	Variances.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	But -::	0
"mn007"::	Is it - i- th- I mean the H_T_K models are diagonal  covariances,  so I d-::	1
"me013"::	That's uh, exactly the  point,  I think, that if you change -::	0
"mn007"::	Is it -::	1
"me013"::	um,::	0
"mn007"::	Hmm.::	0
"me013"::	change what they  are  -::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	It's diagonal  covariance  matrices, but you::	0
"me013"::	say what those  variances  are.::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	So,::	0
"me013"::	that - you know, it's  diagonal,  but the  diagonal  means th- that then you're gonna - it's gonna - it's gonna internally multiply it - and - and uh,::	0
"me013"::	uh, i- it im- uh  implicitly   exponentiated  to get  probabilities,  and so it's - it's gonna -::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	0
"me013"::	it's - it's going to affect the  range  of things if you change the - change the  variances   of some of the features.::	0
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	1
"fn002"::	do?::	0
"me013"::	So, i- it's  precisely  given that model you can very  simply  affect, uh, the s- the  strength  that you apply the  features.::	0
"me013"::	That was - that was, uh, Hari's suggestion.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah. Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So, um -::	0
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	So.  So it could just be that h- treating them equally, tea- treating two streams equally is just - just not the right thing to do.::	0
"me013"::	Of course it's potentially opening a can of worms because,::	1
"me013"::	you know, maybe it should be a different::	0
"me013"::	number for - for each  kind of  test set, or something, but -::	0
"mn007"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah .::	0
"me013"::	So I guess the other thing is to take -::	1
"me013"::	you know - if one were to take, uh, you know, a couple of the most successful of these,::	1
"mn007"::	Yeah, and test across everything.::	1
"me013"::	and uh -::	0
"me013"::	Yeah, try all these different tests.::	1
"mn007"::	Mmm.::	1
"fn002"::	Yeah.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"me013"::	Alright. Uh.::	0
"mn007"::	So, the next point, yeah,::	0
"mn007"::	we've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn,::	0
"mn007"::	um, about their um,::	0
"mn007"::	uh, articulatory stuff,::	0
"mn007"::	um.::	0
"mn007"::	So we'll perhaps start something next week.::	0
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Um, discussion with Hynek, Sunil and Pratibha for::	1
"mn007"::	trying to plug in their::	0
"mn007"::	our -::	0
"mn007"::	our networks with their - within their block diagram,::	1
"mn007"::	uh,  where  to plug in the - the network, uh,::	1
"mn007"::	after the - the feature, before as um::	1
"mn007"::	a- as a plugin or as a- anoth- another path,::	1
"mn007"::	discussion about multi-band and TRAPS,::	0
"mn007"::	um, actually Hynek would like to see,::	1
"mn007"::	perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is,::	1
"mn007"::	uh, temporal L_D_A followed b- by a spectral L_D_A::	0
"mn007"::	for each uh critical band.::	1
"mn007"::	And he would like to replace these by a network::	1
"mn007"::	which would, uh, make the system look like a TRAP.::	1
"mn007"::	Well,::	0
"mn007"::	basically, it would be a TRAP system.::	0
"mn007"::	Basically, this is a TRAP system -::	0
"mn007"::	kind of TRAP system, I mean, but::	0
"mn007"::	where the neural network are replaced by L_D_A.::	0
"mn007"::	Hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Um,::	0
"mn007"::	yeah, and about multi-band,::	0
"mn007"::	uh, I started multi-band M_L_P trainings,::	1
"mn007"::	um::	0
"mn007"::	mmh::	0
"mn007"::	Actually, I w- I w- hhh  prefer to do exactly what I did::	0
"mn007"::	when I was in Belgium.::	0
"mn007"::	So I take exactly the same::	1
"mn007"::	configurations, seven bands with nine frames of context,::	1
"mn007"::	and we just train on TIMIT,::	1
"mn007"::	and on the large database,::	1
"mn007"::	so, with SPINE and everything.::	1
"mn007"::	And, mmm,::	0
"mn007"::	I'm starting to train also, networks with::	1
"mn007"::	larger contexts.::	1
"mn007"::	So, this would - would be something between TRAPS and multi-band because::	1
"mn007"::	we still have quite large bands,::	1
"mn007"::	and - but with a lot of context also.::	1
"mn007"::	So::	0
"mn007"::	Um::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, we still have to work on Finnish,::	1
"mn007"::	um,::	1
"mn007"::	basically, to make a decision on which M_L_P::	0
"mn007"::	can be the best across the different languages.::	1
"mn007"::	For the moment it's the TIMIT network,::	0
"mn007"::	and perhaps::	0
"mn007"::	the network trained on  everything.::	1
"mn007"::	So.::	0
"mn007"::	Now we can test these two networks on -::	0
"mn007"::	with - with delta and::	0
"mn007"::	large networks.::	0
"mn007"::	Well, test them also on Finnish and see::	0
"fn002"::	Mmm.::	0
"mn007"::	which one is the - the -::	0
"mn007"::	the best.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, well, the next part of the document is, well, basically, a kind of summary of what - everything that has been done. So.::	1
"mn007"::	We have seventy-nine M_L_Ps::	0
"mn007"::	trained on::	1
"mn007"::	one, two, three, four, uh, three, four, five,  six, seven::	0
"mn007"::	ten - on ten different databases.::	1
"me013"::	Mm-hmm.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh,::	0
"mn007"::	the number of frames is  bad  also, so we have one million and a half::	0
"mn007"::	for some, three million for other, and six million for the last one.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, yeah!::	1
"mn007"::	As we mentioned, TIMIT is the only::	0
"mn007"::	that's hand-labeled,::	1
"mn007"::	and perhaps this is what makes the difference.::	1
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, the other are just Viterbi-aligned.::	1
"mn007"::	So these seventy-nine M_L_P differ on different things. First,::	0
"mn007"::	um with respect to the on-line normalization,::	0
"mn007"::	there are -::	0
"mn007"::	that use bad on-line normalization,::	0
"mn007"::	and other good on-line normalization.::	0
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"mn007"::	With respect to the features,::	0
"mn007"::	with respect to the use of delta or no,::	0
"mn007"::	uh with respect to the hidden layer size::	0
"mn007"::	and to the targets.::	0
"mn007"::	Uh, but of course we don't have all the combination of these::	0
"mn007"::	different parameters::	0
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"mn007"::	s-::	0
"mn007"::	What's this?::	0
"mn007"::	We only have two hundred eighty six  different  tests::	0
"me013"::	Ugh!::	0
"mn007"::	And no- not two thousand.::	0
"me013"::	I was impressed boy, two thousand.::	0
"me013"::	O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah.::	0
"fn002"::	Ah, yes.::	0
"fn002"::	I say this morning that  @@  thought it was the -::	0
"me013"::	Alright, now I'm just slightly impressed, O_K.::	0
"mn007"::	Um.::	0
"mn007"::	Yeah, basically the observation is what we discussed already.::	1
"mn007"::	The M_S_G problem,::	1
"mn007"::	um,::	0
"mn007"::	the fact that the M_L_P trained on target task decreased the error rate.::	1
"mn007"::	but::	1
"mn007"::	when the M_- M_L_P is trained on the um -::	0
"mn007"::	is not trained on the target task, it increased the error rate compared to using straight features.::	1
"mn007"::	Except if the features are bad -::	0
"mn007"::	uh, actually except if::	0
"mn007"::	the features are not correctly on-line normalized.::	0
"mn007"::	In this case::	0
"mn007"::	the tandem is still better even if it's trained on - not on the target digits.::	0
"me013"::	Yeah. So it sounds like  yeah, the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization.::	0
